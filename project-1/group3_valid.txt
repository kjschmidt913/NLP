<s> In an interview, Mr. Phillips, 30, said the site would give the White House another way to reach the public without having to rely on the mainstream news media. </s> <s> @-@Historically the media

candidacy last year. </s> <s> Obama has long managed to plant himself in both camps, by virtue of his rhetoric and his r@-@sum@-@. </s> <s> In his writings, Obama casts himself as a flexible idealist, a less-partisan Democrat who rejected the dogmas of the @-@60s generation. </s> <s> But largely because of his early stance against the Iraq war, and because he was a onetime community organizer and the first African-American president, liberals felt certain that he had to be, at heart, one of them. </s> <s> By the definition of the word as it came to be used in the early part of the 20th century, Obama is indisputably in the progressive tradition. </s> <s> Like both Roosevelts and Woodrow Wilson, he has pursued financial regulation @-@ radical by the standards of the last two

articles Mr. Clinton emerges in these pages as driven, charismatic, boyish, brainy, self-indulgent, prescient, given to dark moods and yet remarkably resilient and eager to please, a politician riven by contradictions and adept at compartmentalizing different parts of his life, by turns empathetic and profane, defensive and oddly passive. </s> <s> We learn that he wrote the sections of his

Mailer, already an accomplished novelist, sat down to write his first major work of political journalism, an essay for Esquire in which he argued that only John F. Kennedy could save America. </s> <s> In an unruly, haunting and somewhat self-indulgent piece running nearly 14,000 words, Mailer submitted that a mechanized America, with its bland and automated politics, was on the verge of stamping out individuality and randomness and artistic spirit; the only kind of leader who could rescue it, who could sweep in an era of what Mailer called @-@existential@-@ politics, was a @-@hipster@-@ hero @-@ someone who welcomed risk and adventure, someone who sought out new experience, both for himself and for the country. </s> <s> In Kennedy, Mailer saw a man of @-@not quite describable intensity, a suggestion of dry pent heat perhaps,@-@ with @-@the eyes of a mountaineer@-@ and a penchant for risking his life. </s> <s> @-@Indeed, there could be no politics which gave warmth to one@-@s body until the country had recovered its imagination, its pioneer lust for the unexpected and incalculable,@-@ Mailer wrote. </s> <s> @-@It was the changes that might come afterward@-@ @-@ meaning after Kennedy@-@s election @-@ @-@on which one could put one@-@s hope. </s> <s> With such a man in office the myth of the nation would again be engaged, and the fact that he was Catholic would shiver a first existential vibration of consciousness into the mind of the White Protestant. </s> <s> @-@ As it happened, @-@Superman Comes to the Supermarket,@-@ as Mailer@-@s article was titled, had more of an impact on magazine journalism than it did on the politics of the era. </s> <s> With a few clicks @-@ O.

once the transition ends, so, fairly or not, does his lack of accountability for chaotic situations and intractable bureaucracy. </s> <s> Transitions, in this less literal sense, can end well before a president actually takes the oath of office, or they can last for years afterward. </s> <s> Bill Clinton@-@s transition, for instance, was probably cut short when he lost the fight over Zo@-@ Baird, whose nomination for attorney general was derailed because she hadn@-@t paid taxes for her domestic help, or perhaps when a fight erupted in his first days as president over his pledge to allow gays to serve in the military. </s> <s> Liberal ideologues lost whatever faith they still had in Clinton@-@s purity, independents in his ability to bend government to his reformist will. </s> <s> He had squandered his outsider cachet. </s> <s> By contrast, Ronald Reagan@-@s transition was lengthened by the nearly fatal attempt on his life less than three months after his swearing in. </s> <s> @-@The gunman, John Hinckley Jr., shot Reagan and three other men as they exited the Washington Hilton. </s> <s> @-@ How could such an incident not have added credence to Reagan@-@s outsider legend? </s> <s> He had, after all, arrived in the fetid capital as a symbol of popular resistance and renewal, only to have a criminal try to repel him at gunpoint. </s> <s> Reagan@-@s spiking approval ratings in the wake of the assassination attempt afforded him influence over moderates in Washington as well as maneuvering room with some of his most strident backers, enabling him to negotiate a series of significant legislative victories @-@ including tax cuts and changes to Social Security @-@ during his first months in office. </s> <s> He remained a president effectively in transition, more a cultural hero @-@though perhaps not the kind of hero Mailer had in mind@-@ than a practicing politician. </s> <s> Already, in the weeks since the election, Obama has endured the moans of disgruntled constituencies in his own party whose ideal of the outsider is difficult for any breathing politician to fulfill. </s> <s> Progressive activists online and inside the party have complained bitterly about Obama@-@s turning to so many pragmatic insiders @-@ that is, public servants who ran Washington in the Clinton years @-@ to populate his cabinet, rather than reaching out to more academics or state-level politicians whose political instincts have not yet been corroded by Washington@-@s penchant for incrementalism. </s> <s> Then, too, have come the inevitable protests from identity-based interest groups: Latinos and African-Americans in Congress who weren@-@t satisfied with the number of senior appointments, as well as gay activists lamenting the omission of a gay cabinet nominee. </s> <s> That sound you hear is the last wheezing gasp of boomer-age politics, the cataloging of individuals according to their areas of oppression, the endless process of tallying cultural differences rather than aggregating common objectives. </s> <s> It is a political philosophy that probably made sense 30 years ago but that seems sort of baffling at the dawn of the Obama era, when such interest groups are among the most powerful in the Washington establishment @-@ and when the Man himself is black. </s> <s> More strenuous tests of Obama@-@s bond with liberal activists are certain to follow. </s> <s> The insurgent nature of his campaign and the sad, spiraling crash of the Republican opposition have now raised expectations for the sort of transformative agenda that no Democrat has dared pursue since the Great Society. </s> <s> Elated Democrats aren@-@t just envisioning a more progressive energy policy; they want an entirely new economic engine built around eco-friendly technologies and a commitment to scrap the internal combustion engine before Obama@-@s daughters get to college. </s> <s> They won@-@t be satisfied with expanding a few existing health care programs; after decades of talk, they want the national overhaul Obama promised, and sooner rather than later. </s> <s> Closing the prison at Guant@-@namo Bay won@-@t be enough for liberals who want to see investigations and maybe even prosecutions for torture. </s> <s> And yet, in all of these cases, Obama will be tempted @-@ and probably even required @-@ to accept some odious compromises. </s> <s> The bills that emerge from Capitol Hill committees will almost certainly be weighed down with the pet projects of congressmen groveling before their constituents and contributors. </s> <s> The legislative process is like Kryptonite to the existential hero;

it is quite another to have literally invested in him a small chunk of your weekly paycheck @-@ not just once, but repeatedly. </s> <s> @-@In the end, Obama raised roughly @-@750 million on his way to the presidency, or enough to cover the Yankees@-@ payroll for nearly four years. </s> <s> @-@ Those Americans who gave money to the campaign feel more bound to Obama than to any politician in their lifetimes. </s> <s> According to a survey conducted after the election by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, more than half of Obama@-@s online supporters expect to hear directly from the president or his administration in the months ahead, and 62 percent of Obama voters expect that they will urge other people to support his policies. </s> <s> This suggests an intimacy between president and voter that surpasses anything born of the broadcast age. </s> <s> This is what technology does, after all @-@ it closes distances. </s> <s> It@-@s not a coincidence that the Democratic convention in Denver last August felt more like a celebration of a personality than of a political party, in the way that conventions normally do. </s> <s> Everywhere you walked in the city, Obama@-@s face @-@ rendered in the now-iconic red, off-white and blue @-@ seemed to follow like the moon, staring down from banners and the sides of buildings, stenciled onto T-shirts, grafted onto the faces of dolls and watches. </s> <s> To a striking degree, voters seem to feel a personal connection with Obama. </s> <s> This is why they refer to him in interviews, routinely, using only his first name. </s> <s> And it@-@s why millions of them are planning to converge on Washington for this week@-@s inauguration, despite the probability that they will never even glimpse the man, despite the cold and the chaos and the lack of changing tables or porta-potties. </s> <s> They feel as if this is as much their victory, as much their inauguration, as it is his. </s> <s> This new kind of political relationship comes with not only potential but also peril, and you have to imagine that Obama@-@s technology advisers are trying to figure out how to tap the one without inviting the other. </s> <s> On one hand, they have an opportunity to make this president more immediate and more influential than his predecessors; you can imagine Obama, in the months ahead, video-conferencing with voters or mobilizing them by the millions to flood Capitol Hill with virtual petitions. </s> <s> At the same time, Obama@-@s team has to figure out a way to put the presidency online without somehow making the office seem smaller and less regal. </s> <s> This was the lesson @-@ or one of them anyway @-@ from the shrunken presidency of Jimmy Carter, the peanut farmer with the soft voice and the cardigan sweaters who insisted on carrying his own suitcase: Americans like the idea of a people@-@s president, but in practice they prefer him to keep a kind of Olympian remove. </s> <s> We demand that the president know the price of a gallon of milk;

movement@-@s venerable policy centers, which now spend a fair amount of time holding wonderfully esoteric brown-bag lunches about pharmaceutical prices or the British economy while, just down the street, conservative lawmakers are huddling together for warmth. </s> <s> These days, to hear Republicans tell it, the conservative movement@-@s intellectual and strategic thunderbolts seem to be emanating, instead, from an undistinguished box of a building on K Street, amid the city@-@s famed corridor of lobbyists. </s> <s> In unmarked office suites scattered across separate floors, some 35 employees divide their duties among a consulting group, two insurgent policy centers, a documentary-film production company and a public-relations firm with only one client. </s> <s> That client would be the man who sits atop this emerging center of opposition, the once-defeated revolutionary who, like Che or Tito, is best known by a single name: Newt. </s> <s> When most of the nonpolitical world last paid attention to Newt Gingrich, about a decade ago, he was stepping away from public life shrouded in the kind of ignominy that seemed to shadow all the sordid politics of his era. </s> <s> Having delivered House Republicans from decades of suffering in the minority, and having reigned for a brief time as one of the most powerful House speakers since the early part of the 20th century, Gingrich followed the same steep trajectory back down to near irrelevance. </s> <s> Politically, he was badly outflanked by a masterful and more pragmatic Bill Clinton; on a personal level, he was undone by petulance and hypocrisy, whining about his status on Air Force One after a state funeral and carrying on an extramarital affair while impeaching the president for lying about sexual transgressions. </s> <s> He became, in the public mind, a mop-haired caricature, the man depicted on the front page of The Daily News as a crying infant. </s> <s> But while the last 12 months or so have been almost unimaginably dismal for the Republican Party, it has been a pretty great year for Newt. </s> <s> Last spring, as gas prices soared, Gingrich expertly employed the combination of an Internet appeal and some cheerleading from Sean Hannity to popularize his new slogan for increased domestic oil production @-@ @-@Drill here, drill now, pay less@-@ @-@ and delivered to Congress a petition with more than a million signatures in support of more drilling. </s> <s> That campaign stiffened the resolve of Congressional Republicans, who had proved maddeningly inept at harnessing the tools of modern communication in the way their former leader had; they dug in on the issue and ultimately forced Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats into a rare surrender. </s> <s> @-@Even John McCain felt the need to change his position on drilling, leading Republicans to turn their entire convention @-@ @-@Drill, baby, drill! </s> <s> @-@ @-@ into a pep rally for ExxonMobil. </s> <s> @-@ In September,

York Times best-seller list. </s> <s> Now, as Republicans on the Hill begin to awaken from a November beating that left them semiconscious, Gingrich finds himself, once again, at the zenith of influence in conservative Washington. </s> <s> It is a fortuitous collision of man and moment. </s> <s> Having ceded the agenda to a Republican president for the past eight years @-@and having mostly obsessed over White House scandals for much of the decade before that@-@, Republicans now find that they have strikingly little to say that isn@-@t entirely reactive @-@ or reactionary. </s> <s> @-@It was like @-@The Matrix,@-@ when Keanu Reeves wakes up and his eyes hurt because he hasn@-@t used them,@-@ David Winston, a pollster for House Republicans, told me recently, talking about the 2006 election that relegated Republicans to the minority for the first time since 1994. </s> <s> @-@We just didn@-@t know how to do ideas anymore. </s> <s> @-@ Whatever else you think of Gingrich, he has always been considered a prospector in bold and counterintuitive thinking @-@ floating ideas, throughout his career, that have ranged from giving every poor child a laptop to abolishing the entire concept of adolescence. </s> <s> As it happens, Gingrich is also the only guy alive who can actually claim to have led a beleaguered Republican House minority back to power. </s> <s> During the years when Tom DeLay and Karl Rove ruled Washington, conservatives wondered what they had to learn from a has-been who had been forced from power; now they wonder if he might have just a little more magic left under that schoolboy shock of white hair. </s> <s> @-@If you said to me that I could only consult with one individual, and my job was to bring the party back, Newt Gingrich would be the guy,@-@ says Frank Luntz, the pollster who has worked with Gingrich going back to the 1994 Contract With America, the 10-point agenda that Republicans waved around on their way to the majority. </s> <s>

also a little strange. </s> <s> Barack Obama ran for president, you@-@ll recall, on the idea that the politics of the @-@90s @-@ if not the policies that brought about unbridled prosperity @-@ could finally be put behind us. </s> <s> But the @-@90s, it turns out, are not so easily dispatched. </s> <s> Much of Obama@-@s own administration has been culled, perhaps necessarily, from the ranks of those who fought alongside Clinton during those dark years when they and Gingrich@-@s army fought wars of attrition over the budget and impeachment: Rahm Emanuel, Leon Panetta, Hillary Clinton herself. </s> <s> And now here comes their old adversary, back from the political dead, just to make the whole thing seem like some retro reality show @-@ @-@Battle of the Aging Boomers. </s> <s> @-@ Last time around, of course, Democrats got the best of their encounter with Newt. </s> <s> Republicans have to hope that Gingrich, an avid military historian, has learned a thing or two about how to regroup. </s> <s> ON THE NIGHT OF OBAMA@-@S INAUGURATION, Frank Luntz organized a dinner at the Caucus Room, one of those classic Washington expense-account places, with about 15 Republican congressmen and senators, including some in the leadership. </s> <s> Their ears still rang with the jeers of Obama supporters on the Mall, whose taunts, aimed at George W. Bush as he sat placidly through the proceedings, had ricocheted loudly off the walls of the Capitol @-@ it was a final indignity on a day that felt something like a funeral. </s> <s> Dinner was well under way by the time Gingrich arrived, but he proceeded to hold forth for hours, rallying the Republican troops who sat rapt in their chairs. </s> <s> Gingrich was fascinated and impressed by Obama@-@s address @-@Those could have been our words,@-@ he told the group@-@, and he advised them to laminate it and keep it close by, so that they could hold the new president to his pragmatic rhetoric. </s> <s> He urged them to go after the nomination of the incoming Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, who had been one of the architects of the bailout plan Gingrich found so odious and who was now in trouble over unpaid taxes. </s> <s> The next day, at Geithner@-@s confirmation hearing, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate and one of the dinner guests that night, ripped into Geithner, calling it @-@incomprehensible@-@ that the nominee for Treasury hadn@-@t known whether he had fully paid his income taxes while he was at the International Monetary Fund. </s> <s> At a Republican retreat two weeks later in Virginia, Peter Roskam, an Illinois congressman who also attended the dinner, showed up with laminated copies of excerpts from Obama@-@s inaugural address and handed them out to his colleagues. </s> <s> The point of this story isn@-@t that Gingrich is some kind of mind-controlling charlatan @-@ although if you talk long enough to the small cadre of loyalists who have been with him for the better part of 30 years, you might start to wonder. </s> <s> It@-@s more that Republicans right now are desperately looking for direction from someone, ideally someone who knows how to handle an opposition president with a 65-percent approval rating. </s> <s> Normally this role would fall to a charismatic Congressional boss or to a vaunted strategist with a record of success. </s> <s> At the moment, Republicans have neither. </s> <s> The House leader, John Boehner, is a dealmaker of the 1980s Republican variety @-@ smoker@-@s voice, sculptured hair, a lobbyist@-@s pinstripe suit. </s> <s> He@-@s a solid guy, the kind you could golf with or put on your board of directors, but nothing about him makes you want to charge toward a machine-gun battery to take a hill. </s> <s> Over on the Senate side, Mitch McConnell, an expert floor tactician, seems about as socially uncomfortable as a man can be and still reach the pinnacle of politics. </s> <s> The closest thing the party has to a grand strategist, Karl Rove, offers most of his wisdom on Fox News, prompting a lot of Republicans who endured his tirades during the Bush years to shudder and change the channel. </s> <s> The breach here is plenty wide, and Gingrich is nothing if not politically agile. </s> <s> He has maintained, from his days in Congress, close relationships with colleagues who still serve in the House or who, like Kyl, have now moved on to the Senate. </s> <s> He has forged new alliances with leaders of the next generation as well @-@ most notably Eric Cantor, the Virginia congressman who is minority whip, just below Boehner in the hierarchy. </s> <s> Then there is the group of senior aides that includes Paula Nowakowski, Boehner@-@s chief of staff, who told me she is barraged almost daily with what she calls Newtgrams @-@ e-mail messages from Gingrich with lists of policy ideas, questions or advice on how to handle the caucus. </s> <s> Another frequent recipient is Paul Ryan, a young Wisconsin congressman and Gingrich prot@-@g@-@ known for burrowing into budget issues. </s> <s> Ryan told me he was opening presents with his children on Christmas when his BlackBerry buzzed with a question about the tax code. </s> <s> @-@He@-@s a total idea factory,@-@ Ryan said. </s> <s> @-@The man will have 10 ideas in an hour. </s> <s> Six of them will be brilliant, two of them are in the stratosphere and two of them I@-@ll just flat-out disagree with. </s> <s> And then you@-@ll get 10 more ideas in the next hour. </s> <s> @-@A lot of these e-mail messages are deeply wonkish, written in single-sentence paragraphs without punctuation or capital letters. </s> <s> It@-@s almost as if you can see Gingrich twittering away at a Starbucks while doing calculations on a wrinkled napkin. </s> <s> On Thanksgiving Day, for instance, in an e-mail message one recipient shared with me, Gingrich fired off a riff on an idea by Louie Gohmert, a Republican congressman from Texas, who had suggested that, instead of a stimulus bill, the party propose a payroll-tax holiday. </s> <s> @-@FICA and personal income tax combined are about @-@160 billion a month @-@you might want to check my math@-@,@-@ Gingrich wrote to a group of Congressional allies. </s> <s> @-@So if Pelosi proposes a @-@700 billion stimulus spending package in January, we could propose a 4-month tax holiday as the alternative. </s> <s> @-@ In a separate e-mail message to his own aides, he wrote: @-@Think of no personal or corporate income tax and no fica tax for a year as a stimulus package. </s> <s> Am I nuts in rome or is the contrast startling. </s> <s> @-@The tax-holiday idea never really went anywhere. </s> <s> Republican leaders in Congress were fixated on a more tactical question: whether the party risked more by opposing Obama outright or by exploring some kind of compromise with him. </s> <s> What they sought from Gingrich wasn@-@t the policy ideas of an unorthodox thinker so much as the strategic insight of the last Republican heavyweight to have mixed it up with a deft Democratic president. </s> <s> A few days after the inauguration, I met Eric Cantor at a bench outside the House chamber, and we walked @-@ jogged, actually @-@ across the street to the Longworth Building, where the Ways and Means Committee was marking up the Democratic stimulus bill. </s> <s> Cantor is just two years younger than Obama, and you can see how he might emerge in the years ahead as the president@-@s generational opposite, in the same way that Gingrich and Bill Clinton often seemed to bring out in each other their long-dormant high school personas. </s> <s> Where Obama sweeps through a room, effortless and aloof, the wiry Cantor emits a kind of nerdy intensity, like an actuary who really loves his work. </s> <s> Cantor says @-@frankly@-@ a lot, usually just before he says something that@-@s highly calibrated. </s> <s> I asked Cantor whether Gingrich was giving him useful advice for how to navigate the current moment. </s> <s> @-@Every day, every day,@-@ he told me. </s> <s> @-@You want specifics? </s> <s> @-@ I nodded. </s> <s> @-@Well, generally, he is very quick to see the historic election of President Obama and the potential for his support to last, and what that means for Congress, and how we compare the success of Barack Obama to, frankly, the difficulties that Speaker Pelosi and Leader Reid are having with the American public right now,@-@ Cantor said. </s> <s> @-@You know, Congressional Democrats are nowhere near where this president is right now in terms of public opinion. </s> <s> @-@ Cantor listed some of the more extreme liberal forces @-@ he mentioned Code Pink, the women@-@s antiwar group, and the @-@radical environmental movement,@-@ which were about the most provocative examples he could come up with off the top of his head @-@ that seemed, in his view, to hold sway among Democrats in Congress but whom Obama, with his centrist outlook, might need to defy. </s> <s> @-@If you watch where he@-@s going, since he@-@s been elected he@-@s sort of rejected some of the campaign rhetoric and said we have to deliberate, we have to be thoughtful,@-@ Cantor went on. </s> <s> @-@He understands the burdens of the office and at the same time understands that this is a center-right country. </s> <s> We@-@re closer to that, frankly, than the majority in the House. </s> <s> @-@ THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I had heard any Republican leader describe this tactical approach, and it struck me as surprising. </s> <s> Like most everyone else, I had assumed that Republicans were confronting a single, difficult question: How do you contrast yourself favorably with a wildly popular new president at a time of great urgency when you yourself are about as popular as acne? </s> <s> @-@In a poll conducted by the firm Research 2000 last month, Boehner@-@s approval rating hit a new low of 18 percent. </s> <s> @-@ But Cantor was suggesting that Republicans might not need to contrast themselves with Obama at all @-@ that, in fact, by appearing to share Obama@-@s basically moderate impulse toward policy, they could instead contrast themselves with Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, with an eye toward picking up some seats in 2010. </s> <s> In the weeks after my meeting with Cantor, Congressional Democrats began to discern the outlines of this strategy as well, complaining that Republicans were trying to drive a wedge between them and Obama by appearing to embrace the president while criticizing the ideological rigidity of his party. </s> <s> As Gingrich explained it to me back in November, just after the election, what he had been preaching to Cantor and other House Republicans was actually more radical than that. </s> <s> Gingrich, who likes to reduce the world to binary options, saw two basic paths for Obama: either he was going to cater to interest groups and his Congressional wing, or he was going to take a more centrist, more reformist approach to governing. </s> <s> If he chose Door No. </s> <s> 1, then Republicans had to propose a thoughtful, alternate agenda of their own. </s> <s> @-@Screaming @-@No! </s> <s> @-@ is just not a strategy,@-@ Gingrich told me. </s> <s> But he said he was betting that Obama would take the second approach @-@ that he meant what he said about leaving the old doctrines behind and intended to govern in a way that might fundamentally realign American politics. </s> <s> And if that were the case, Gingrich reasoned, not only would it be politically unpalatable to stand in Obama@-@s way, but chances were he would soon face serious fractures within his own party and would need to create a broader coalition of partners to get his initiatives through the Congress. </s> <s> In other words, Gingrich wasn@-@t suggesting to Cantor and the others that they should simply pretend to like Obama well enough. </s> <s> He was telling them that if Obama was going to move far enough in their direction, their best play @-@ and maybe their only play @-@ was actually to team up with him on legislation if they could. </s> <s> @-@I already told the House and Senate Republicans, if Obama decides to govern from the center, you have to work with him,@-@ Gingrich told me. </s> <s> @-@He@-@s the president of the United States. </s> <s> If the president of the United States walks in with a rational, moderate proposal which has his left wing up in arms and you don@-@t help him, you look like you@-@re a nihilistic party of reactionary opposition. </s> <s> @-@ He pointed to the model of Lyndon Johnson and Sam Rayburn, the Democratic tandem in the Senate and House who worked amiably with Dwight Eisenhower and, in so doing, split the Republican Party for years to come. </s> <s> @-@I don@-@t actually build oppositions,@-@ Gingrich told me, as if this business of salvaging a lost party were something he undertook every couple of months. </s> <s> @-@I build the next governing majority. </s> <s> I have no interest in being an opposition party. </s> <s> @-@As a first test of this theory of engagement, however, negotiations over Obama@-@s stimulus plan cast doubt on how sincere Republicans were about emulating a Johnson-Rayburn model. </s> <s> At first, Republicans in the House and Senate went out of their way to praise the president, who staked out a negotiating position by including @-@250 billion worth of tax cuts in his initial proposal. </s> <s> Obama came to the Hill for a 90-minute meeting and seemed apologetic, according to Republicans who participated, for the way the House minority had been shut out of the rule-making process. </s> <s> Cantor led an economic working group in coming up with alternative ideas for the bill @-@ basically the kind of deep tax cuts the Democrats had already rejected @-@ and he and Boehner then delivered them to the president. </s> <s> @-@I@-@ve been with him four times now, and he continues to at least listen,@-@ Cantor told me during a phone conversation before the vote. </s> <s> Meanwhile, in a speech at the National Press Club, McConnell sounded similarly conciliatory, vowing to @-@choose bipartisan solutions over partisan failures every time. </s> <s> @-@ House Democrats, however, still recalling the way Republicans treated them during their years in the minority, designed their bill as if all the Republicans had just been carted away to Guant@-@namo Bay. </s> <s> Whatever actual resolve Republicans may have had to work across party lines seemed to dissolve overnight, and they reverted to the more familiar stance of reflexive opposition. </s> <s> Despite some grumbling among Democrats on the Hill, Obama@-@s majority didn@-@t fracture, as Gingrich and his minions might have hoped. </s> <s> In the end, House Republican leaders demanded that their members vote unanimously against the bill, and in the Senate, even after the package was trimmed in a concession to centrists from both parties, only the remaining dinosaurs from the party@-@s Northeastern establishment crossed the aisle. </s> <s> Obama himself, sounding markedly less bipartisan, skewered the diminished G. O. P. as a party that did, in fact, reflexively scream no, and Republicans did little to counter the impression; in an ill-advised remark to the National Journal@-@s Hotline, Pete Sessions, the Texas congressman and chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, suggested that insurgent Republicans had a lot to learn from the Taliban. </s> <s> And yet, in fruitlessly trying to obstruct Obama@-@s gargantuan stimulus bill, Republicans had come away with an issue by which to define themselves. </s> <s> It turned out that they actually could stand up to Obama, soaring approval ratings and all, and live to see another vote, and that provided a psychological boost to a minority party that had seemed cowed and confused. </s> <s> Just as important, judging from the polls and media coverage, they had at least managed to introduce a reasonable doubt about the stimulus plan into the jury box of public opinion, a note of skepticism that might linger in the months ahead. </s> <s> Republicans had taken the calculated risk, of course, that if the economy improved, Democrats would throw the vote back at them in the 2010 elections. </s> <s> But at least now, having presented a philosophical alternative, they could run against the bill in 2010 if it turned out only to swell the deficit without creating the jobs that Obama had forecast. </s> <s> The night after lodging their protest against the bill on the House floor, Republican congressmen arrived at a retreat in Virginia feeling jubilant for the first time since before the presidential campaign. </s> <s> Waiting for them there was the evening@-@s keynote speaker @-@ Gingrich, of course. </s> <s> Having seen his engage-and-divide strategy founder almost immediately when it came to the stimulus, Gingrich seemed to have changed his mind about Obama and resorted to his more instinctual, more confrontational cast. </s> <s> No longer did he talk of Obama as the kind of centrist guy you could get your arms around. </s> <s> In the coming days, in fact, he would deride the president@-@s @-@left-wing policies@-@ while at the same time accuse him of @-@Nixonian@-@ abuses of power. </s> <s> On this night, Gingrich congratulated his troops on standing united and inspired them with stories about Charles de Gaulle@-@s heroism and George Washington at Valley Forge, as well as the football legends Joe Paterno and Vince Lombardi. </s> <s> Now was the time for Republicans to rediscover their principles, Gingrich told the congressmen. </s> <s> At one point, he likened himself, lightheartedly, to Moses. </s> <s> He@-@d help them cross the Red Sea once again, Gingrich vowed, but only if they promised, this time, to stay on the other side. </s> <s> @-@ BEFORE HE BECAME A CONGRESSMAN, Newt Gingrich, Ph. </s> <s> D., taught history at West Georgia College. </s> <s> Interviewing Gingrich, as I did on three occasions recently, is like stopping by the office of your thesis adviser when your thesis adviser has better things to do with his time. </s> <s> Polite but impatient, Gingrich answers most questions pedagogically, with impromptu seminars on history or social theory. </s> <s> It seems important to him that you know how much he knows @-@ which, truth be told, is quite a lot. </s> <s> There are moments when this routine can verge on the absurd, like something out of a Ricky Gervais sketch. </s> <s> At one point, I asked Gingrich, now a healthful-looking 65, about his sudden exit from Congress in 1998. </s> <s> @-@First of all, in the Toynbeean sense, I believe in departure and return,@-@ he told me. </s> <s> @-@In the what sense? </s> <s> @-@ I asked. </s> <s> @-@Arnold Toynbee,@-@ he replied matter-of-factly, referring to the English writer Arnold J. Toynbee, who wrote @-@A Study of History. </s> <s> @-@ @-@I believe in the sense that, you know, De Gaulle had to go to Colombey-les-Deux-@-@glises for 11 years. </s> <s> @-@I@-@m sorry? </s> <s> @-@Departure and return. </s> <s> And someone once said to me, if you don@-@t leave, you can@-@t come back, because you@-@ve never left. </s> <s> @-@I was still trying to process this nugget when the slouching Gingrich, now onto a point about steel plants closing, jolted upright. </s> <s> @-@The 1913 Girl Scouts manual! </s> <s> @-@ he said, or at least that@-@s what it sounded like. </s> <s> @-@Which I should get a copy of. </s> <s> @-@ He punched a button on his phone and dialed his assistant. </s> <s> @-@Yes, sir? </s> <s> @-@ @-@Can you get me about four copies of the 1913 Girl Scouts manual, @-@How Girls Can Help Their Country@-@? </s> <s> @-@ Gingrich asked. </s> <s> There was a long pause on the other end.@-@O. </s> <s> K.@-@I think it@-@s on Amazon,@-@ Gingrich said helpfully. </s> <s> He leaned back and proceeded to explain to me that the Girl Scouts manual contained a recommendation that every girl learn to perform two jobs, just in case one of them went away. </s> <s> What we needed, apparently, were more steelworkers who belonged to the Girl Scouts. </s> <s> Republicans had been in the minority for 24 years when suburban Atlanta sent the 35-year-old Gingrich to the House of Representatives in 1978, and they had just about accepted that their status there wouldn@-@t change in any of their lifetimes. </s> <s> From the day he arrived and began ascending the levels of leadership, Gingrich was the one guy who woke up every morning determined to reverse the flow of history. </s> <s> @-@He was himself the counterculture,@-@ Frank Luntz says. </s> <s> @-@If people had run their own local campaigns up to then, he nationalized them. </s> <s> If people ran simplistically, he made it more complicated. </s> <s> If people ran by telling you why their opponents stunk, he ran by telling you why his side was better. </s> <s> He did the opposite of everything that had been done up to then, because everything up to then had been a disaster. </s> <s> @-@Even now, all these years later, when you ask Republicans from that era what went wrong @-@ how it was that Gingrich resigned from Congress just four years after finally becoming speaker, having suffered a major defeat at the polls and having seen his approval rating fall to 11 percent @-@ you get a lot of blank looks and tortured shrugs. </s> <s> It@-@s as if the thing exploded so quickly that no one ever had time to reassemble the parts and figure out where the malfunction was. </s> <s> But whether the igniter was impeachment or the budget shutdown, everyone agrees that it was probably as much an issue of temperament as of circumstance. </s> <s> Gingrich is a historian and a futurist; he@-@s comfortable looking backward or ahead, but he doesn@-@t actually do all that well with the present. </s> <s> Possessed of a chaotic mind that moves from one obsession to the next, Gingrich flailed from objective to objective, while his missteps came to dominate the news. </s> <s> Then, too, there was the question of what to do with power. </s> <s> Gingrich has often been prescient in his thinking about social change. </s> <s> In his first book, @-@Window of Opportunity,@-@ published in 1984 with a weird @-@Dune@-@ sort of cover featuring an eagle and a space shuttle, Gingrich wrote of a day when a growing number of Americans would work from their homes rather than commute to offices, using their own personal computers along with @-@information-set@-@ telephones that would transmit vast amounts of data over the phone lines. </s> <s> This was when most of America was just discovering the Commodore 64. </s> <s> @-@Gingrich also predicted that factories would soon be making alloy metals in space, although he did say that this could happen only if we pursued the right policies, which, clearly, we did not. </s> <s> @-@ And yet, in his machinations to bring his party back to power, Gingrich became preoccupied with process. </s> <s> The Contract With America was mostly a call to reform the institution of Congress; moving beyond it, turning the corner from rebellion to governance, required workable ideas beyond slashing programs and taxes. </s> <s> When Gingrich looks back now on the days after his resignation, he sounds genuinely relieved. </s> <s> @-@It took me probably five seconds to switch personal assignments,@-@ he told me recently, @-@because my dad was a career soldier, and I@-@d been through change-of-command ceremonies. </s> <s> I got it. </s> <s> @-@ @-@At one point, I asked Gingrich why he hadn@-@t followed his father into the Army. </s> <s> @-@I was nearsighted and flat-footed,@-@ he told me. </s> <s> @-@What did your dad think of that? </s> <s> @-@ I asked. </s> <s> @-@That I was nearsighted and flat-footed,@-@ he replied. </s> <s> @-@ Freed from the constraints of governing, Gingrich turned chiefly to two pursuits: making money, which he did through speeches and television punditry, and exploring ideas, especially in the realm of technology and modernization. </s> <s> The jewels of his small empire on K Street are his two policy centers: the Center for Health Transformation, which is actually a for-profit association of health care providers, and the newer American Solutions, which churns out research on a broader array of issues. </s> <s> Gingrich is all about offering, as he puts it, a @-@better value@-@ for the American customer @-@ constructive solutions Republicans can take on the road during the next midterm election season and beyond. </s> <s> @-@Most Republicans are not entrepreneurial,@-@ he lamented to me. </s> <s> @-@They@-@re corporatists. </s> <s> They like the security and the comfort of a well-thought-out, highly boring boardroom meeting in which they do a PowerPoint once. </s> <s> And it worries them to have ideas, because ideas have edges, and they@-@re not totally formed, and you@-@ve got to prove them, and they sound strange because they@-@re new, and if it@-@s new how do you know it@-@s any good, because, after all, it@-@s new and you@-@ve never heard it before. </s> <s> @-@At our first meeting in November, Gingrich laid out for me his latest preoccupation, which, surprisingly, had nothing to do with stimulus or banking. </s> <s> @-@One of the projects I@-@m going to launch @-@ we don@-@t have a name for it yet @-@ is an air-traffic modernization project,@-@ Gingrich told me excitedly. </s> <s> @-@You can do a space-based air-traffic-control system with half the current number of air-traffic controllers, increase the amount of air traffic in the northeast by 40 percent, allow point-to-point flights without the controllers having to have highways in the sky, and reduce the amount of aviation fuel by 10 percent. </s> <s> So it@-@s better for the environment, better for the economy. </s> <s> You have far fewer delays in New York, and by the way, you cut the number of unionized air-traffic controllers by 7,000. </s> <s> @-@Our thematic is going to be @-@ you@-@re going to love this @-@ that if you have an air-traffic delay that@-@s not caused by weather, take the extra time at the airport and call your two senators and your congressman and demand they pass the modernization act,@-@ Gingrich enthused. </s> <s> @-@Now, notice what I@-@m doing,@-@ he said, leaning back and smiling. </s> <s> @-@I@-@m offering you a better value. </s> <s> @-@It sounded like a cool idea, to be sure, as long as you weren@-@t one of those poor air-traffic controllers, who, for whatever reason, have been on the wrong side of Republicans since Reagan fired them in 1981. </s> <s> But it was hard to imagine Republicans outflanking Obama, as we stood on the brink of global panic, by promising a better on-time ratio for Delta. </s> <s> This has long been the chief criticism of Gingrich among those who share his ideological convictions @-@ that there is a randomness to his brilliance, a lack of prioritization or discipline. </s> <s> Gingrich may be an @-@idea factory,@-@ as Paul Ryan puts it, but it sometimes seems like a factory working on triple shifts without a floor manager or anyone keeping the books. </s> <s> Even Gingrich@-@s modestly bulging waistline, which expands and contracts on some kind of lunar schedule to which only fellow Republicans seem especially attuned, is mentioned as evidence that Gingrich can@-@t focus on any one objective for very long. </s> <s> The ideas Gingrich promotes seem to rotate every few weeks, depending on the book he has just torn through or the especially illuminating conversation he has just had, or simply on where his earnest fascination with policy has taken him this morning. </s> <s> One day it@-@s his energy plan, which includes not just drilling offshore and in the oil-shale-packed mountainous West but also the kind of massive investment in solar and wind power and biofuels that Obama and other Democrats favor. </s> <s> On another day it might be his favorite education idea, which entails a plan to reward low-income high-school students who graduate early with a college scholarship equal to the value of the money they@-@re saving the school system. </s> <s> There@-@s not really any unified, easily distillable argument in these and other proposals, no ideology that might be charted on a continuum and labeled accordingly. </s> <s> Rather, the new-model Newt seems to be pursuing a ruthlessly responsive, almost-wikified brand of politics. </s> <s> His goal is to turn the Republicans into what he calls a @-@party of the American people@-@ by linking disparate solutions whose only real relationship to one another is that they demonstrate, in surveys, what he calls @-@tripartisan@-@ appeal @-@ the broad support of Republicans, Democrats and independents. </s> <s> Gingrich told me he has identified about 100 ideas and positions that command anywhere from 62 percent to 93 percent support among such a cross-section of voters: giving out tax credits for installing alternative heating sources in your home @-@90 percent@-@; awarding cash prizes to anyone who invents a car that gets 100 miles to the gallon @-@77 percent@-@; keeping God in the Pledge of Allegiance @-@88 percent@-@. </s> <s> Gingrich@-@s vision @-@ much more Clintonian than Reaganite @-@ is to use targeted initiatives to create a kind of mechanized compatibility with the masses. </s> <s> What must be obvious even to Gingrich is that none of these calculations have much to do with what his acolytes in Congress want from him right now. </s> <s> Rather, what Republicans on the Hill value about Gingrich is that he has something to say about every issue, a parry for every feint, a sense of certainty and plainspokenness in confronting policy issues that most Republicans have either ignored for a decade or reduced to hopelessly leaden detail. </s> <s> Gingrich thinks about ideas strategically, as a way of countering his opponents or wooing new constituencies, and this is something Republicans have failed to do almost from the day he left Capitol Hill. </s> <s> The party@-@s besieged leaders aren@-@t looking to Gingrich to be the architect of some grand new philosophical structure. </s> <s> Rather, they@-@re hoping he can help erect some armaments around the ideological fortress in which they now find themselves trapped, in danger of being completely overrun. </s> <s> I SPENT A LOT OF TIME reporting on the world of progressive politics after the 2004 election, and it@-@s hard to miss the nearly perfect symmetry between that Democratic moment and the one Republicans find themselves confronting today. </s> <s> Like Democrats after John Kerry@-@s defeat, Republicans now whine about their failed strategists or their flawed candidate or a media that refuses to expose the obvious deficiency of their opponents. </s> <s> The Democratic establishment in 2005 was under assault from online activists who demanded that the party modernize its message and appeal to voters in all 50 states; now conservative blogs like The Next Right and The New Majority are making the exact same argument daily. </s> <s> Wealthy Democrats got behind a policy group called the Center for American Progress because, they said, the left had no intellectual or rapid response @-@infrastructure@-@ to compete with the likes of Heritage and Cato. </s> <s> It@-@s almost comical, then, to hear senior Republicans complain now that none of their policy groups have the capacity to compete with a liberal behemoth like the Center for American Progress. </s> <s> The conversation dominating Republican politics is how to rebuild. </s> <s> There are no neatly distinct schools of thought in this inchoate debate. </s> <s> In an important sense, though, the argument in Republican circles is the same one that preoccupied Democrats in 2005 @-@ that is, whether the party@-@s priority should be to retrench ideologically or whether it is more important to fan out in search of a broader message and audience. </s> <s> These aren@-@t really mutually exclusive schools of thought @-@ most influential Republicans will tell you they need to do both @-@ but which approach you emphasize says a lot about what kind of Republican Party you would like to emerge from the ruins of Bushism. </s> <s> The retrenchers see the Bush era principally as a cautionary tale in forgetting where you came from. </s> <s> In their view, Bush and the Republican Congress proved to be about as grounded in conservative principle, fiscally and internationally, as Jimmy Carter and Tip O@-@Neill @-@ spending the nation into debt with patronage projects, going soft on immigration, passing a massive entitlement program for prescription drugs, piling up indictments and mismanaging the military. </s> <s> Republicans lost the public not because their ideology became less relevant or less credible, the retrenchers argue, but because it was twisted in the morass of governing. </s> <s> The only way back, then, is for the party to rededicate itself either to fiscal conservatism or social conservatism or some combination of the two, which means, first and foremost, exposing Obama and Democrats on the Hill for the elitist liberals they really are. </s> <s> As a broad generalization, most of those talking the loudest about retrenchment and confrontation are in the activist wing of the party; they@-@re the death-before-taxes conservatives or the picket-abortion-clinics conservatives or the online conservatives who incline, like their liberal counterparts, toward ideological purity. </s> <s> I got a sense of what this kind of combative approach might sound like when I called Grover Norquist, the anti-tax zealot who convenes a weekly meeting of influential Republican operatives. </s> <s> Norquist was fuming that Obama, who had pledged not to raise taxes on anyone but the wealthy, had just signed a children@-@s health care bill that included a tax on cigarettes. </s> <s> @-@He@-@s a liar,@-@ Norquist said of the president. </s> <s> @-@He knew he was lying the whole time. </s> <s> Shame on him. </s> <s> He can no longer look us in the eye and say he won the election fair and square. </s> <s> @-@ This seemed a little strong to me @-@ it wasn@-@t as if Obama had just dumped nine million stolen votes out of a suitcase onto his desk @-@ but Norquist was getting himself worked up now. </s> <s> @-@Rich people like him can afford an extra 61 cents,@-@ he went on. </s> <s> @-@Poor people can@-@t. And he does not care. </s> <s> @-@ For those Republicans you might call broadeners, on the other hand, rants against the new president are a losing proposition. </s> <s> More reform-minded than ideological, they look at the Bush debacle as the predictable failure of insular and extremist politics @-@ a retreat from the @-@compassionate conservatism@-@ that Bush once promised. </s> <s> Conservatism, in their view, does not mean catering to a dwindling base of white and older voters, big business and evangelicals, while younger voters, women, urbanites and minorities recoil from the Republican brand. </s> <s> Much of the energy here is coming from the governors, who as a rule are forced by political reality to take a less divisive approach to governing. </s> <s> Several of them @-@ including two of McCain@-@s strongest backers last fall, Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Charlie Crist of Florida @-@ went as far as to publicly get behind Obama@-@s stimulus, which they badly needed to plug gaping holes in their budgets. </s> <s> This intramural disagreement raises basic questions for Republicans about what kind of party they actually want to be in the 21st century. </s> <s> Is the Republican future going to continue to rely on country-club denizens and the rural bloc, or should it aim more for working-class Catholics or recent immigrants? </s> <s> Can a party trying to expand its coalition afford to make fundamentalist religious values a core tenet of its ideology? </s> <s> Or to assault the very idea of government? </s> <s> In many ways, as the most-blogged-about politician since the election, Sarah Palin has become a kaleidoscope through which to view these questions. </s> <s> For many Republicans, the Alaska governor and hockey mom is the new and galvanizing face of conservative America; to others, Palin personifies everything that@-@s wrong with the party, an approach short on intellect and long on cultural resentment. </s> <s> Gingrich seems to have decided not to choose sides in this debate. </s> <s> On one hand, he holds himself up as the heir to the more progressive, reformist tradition in of his party, an intellectual provocateur in the model of early progressives like Teddy Roosevelt, Robert La Follette and Hiram Johnson. </s> <s> Twice during our conversations, Gingrich referred me to the chapter in Theodore White@-@s @-@Making of the President, 1960@-@ in which White describes how Roosevelt led the progressives out of the Republican Party, leaving behind a more reactionary, isolationist wing that would dominate the party for most of the next 50 years. </s> <s> To Gingrich, this is the same tension that exists today, and he describes it as a continuing struggle between ideas and ignorance, between one group that always wants to modernize the party and another that@-@s nostalgic for the past. </s> <s> And yet, at the same time, Gingrich pointedly declines to do what Roosevelt and La Follette did, which is to directly confront the Republican orthodoxies of their day. </s> <s> Those reformers demanded their fellow Republicans make a choice between ideas and ignorance. </s> <s> By contrast, Gingrich doesn@-@t really challenge any core ideological precept of the Bush era @-@ only the strategy of @-@base mobilization@-@ that underlay it. </s> <s> Nor do the last several months of economic calamity seem to have ignited in him any of the populist fervor that energized an earlier generation of progressives. </s> <s> His main remedy for the financial crisis has been to repeal the Sarbanes-Oxley law that Congress passed to step up regulation after the Enron scandal; Gingrich claims such accounting rules as @-@mark to market@-@ are needlessly crippling banks and small businesses. </s> <s> In other words, his prescription for the runaway financial industry is to regulate it less @-@ a position that hardly sounds like a departure from Bush, let alone progressive or insurrectionary. </s> <s> At a moment when the role of religious fundamentalism in the party is a central question for reformers, Gingrich, rather than making any kind of case for a new enlightenment, has in fact gone to great lengths to placate Christian conservatives. </s> <s> The family-values crowd has never completely embraced Newt, probably because he has been married three times, most recently to a former Hill staff member, Callista Bisek. </s> <s> In 2006, though, Gingrich wrote a book called @-@Rediscovering God in America@-@ @-@ part of a new canon of work he has done reaffirming the role of religion in public life. </s> <s> The following year, he went on radio with the evangelical leader James Dobson to apologize for having been unfaithful to his second wife. </s> <s> @-@A Baptist since graduate school, Gingrich said he will soon convert to Catholicism, his wife@-@s faith. </s> <s> @-@ Gingrich@-@s defining strength as a speechifier is his ability to read a crowd. </s> <s> He@-@s not a gifted orator like Obama nor especially magnetic like Clinton, but admirers marvel at his capacity to gauge what works and integrate it into his standard routine. </s> <s> In a sense, this is what Gingrich did in the @-@90s. </s> <s> He saw early on how the culture of scandal was changing politics, and he managed to take down Jim Wright, the reigning Democratic speaker, over a book deal. </s> <s> He heard the public@-@s frustration with the culture of Congress, internalized it and converted it into a 10-point contract and the undoing of the political order. </s> <s> Similarly, the tripartisan Newt is a Republican prototype engineered to succeed in the pragmatic age of Obama. </s> <s> @-@Newt is very good at popularizing conservative approaches in ways that seem appealing to people,@-@ John Podesta, President Clinton@-@s last chief of staff and now president of the Center for American Progress, suggested when we talked. </s> <s> @-@In a party that@-@s desperate and out of ideas and carries the burden of being identified with Bush, Newt will figure out how to escape that trap by making it seem like he had nothing to do with all that and that he has ideas that are salient to today@-@s political climate. </s> <s> @-@In fact, I think Bush pursued the macroeconomic policies that Newt pursued in the 1990s,@-@ Podesta told me. </s> <s> @-@Newt@-@s a legitimate reformer, but I don@-@t really think he@-@s in the progressive tradition. </s> <s> @-@ IN 1962, TWO YEARS PAST A NARROW presidential defeat, Richard Nixon got walloped in a race for California governor, went downstairs to the ballroom at the Beverly Hilton and put his career out of its misery. </s> <s> @-@You won@-@t have Nixon to kick around anymore. </s> <s> @-@ Nixon then faded into the background and watched from a distance while Barry Goldwater borrowed the keys to the party and crashed it headlong into a wall, leaving twisted wreckage and no one with the stature to fix it. </s> <s> Suddenly Republicans found themselves in need of a serious mind, even one with serious flaws. </s> <s> By 1969, Nixon, who fulfilled no one@-@s concept of glamorous, was unpacking boxes in the Oval Office. </s> <s> Newt Gingrich had to wait a little longer for his rehabilitation, but there are parallels between Nixon@-@s journey and his. </s> <s> It may seem inconceivable to those outside the party, the idea of this aging, white-haired holdover from the @-@90s going up against the incumbent Obama in 2012. </s> <s> And yet, in Republican Washington, the idea is taken quite seriously. </s> <s> @-@If you were going to make a list of 10 potential Republican nominees, Newt would be on any list,@-@ Norquist told me. </s> <s> @-@He@-@s probably in most people@-@s Top 5. </s>

back of a Cadillac Escalade in the first week of February, on his way to a speech, Gingrich told me he would have to make a decision about the next election by the early weeks of 2011. </s> <s> He and his wife just finished making a documentary about Reagan, and he said he had been thinking about how Reagan had found his way to the presidency only after he had focused most of his energy on shaping a political movement. </s> <s> Gingrich said he was focused on building his own movement, his party of the American people. </s> <s> @-@Now, if in that process I end up helping to shape the ideas and the language and the solutions that for a long period of time define the choices in America, then I@-@ve succeeded,@-@ he said. </s> <s> @-@If in that process personal ambition leads to the presidency, that@-@s fine, but it@-@s a secondary achievement, I think. </s> <s> @-@I said I doubted anyone could be elected president if he actually felt that way. </s> <s> @-@I think I@-@m closer to Benjamin Franklin than to George Washington,@-@ Gingrich told me. </s> <s> @-@I@-@m a contributor to my country and to my times. </s> <s> If it turns out that there@-@s a moment when it makes sense to run, then I@-@ll run. </s> <s> But if I end up never being able to run, then it won@-@t devastate me. </s> <s> @-@Politicians say things like this all the time, albeit without the grand historical

oddity of the speaker@-@s job that a person can gain national power and never be elected by voters outside a single district in Georgia. </s> <s> @-@ For Gingrich, it@-@s about the theories and the

trouble,@-@ Jonathan Alter wrote in @-@The Defining Moment,@-@ his history of F. D. R.@-@s first 100 days. </s> <s> And then Roosevelt executed a leadership tour de force that lifted the nation@-@s spirits, swept his New Deal agenda through Congress and durably transformed the federal role in American society. </s> <s> In other words, it may not be too early to ask whether Tom Daschle@-@s tax problems, Judd Gregg@-@s ideological misgivings, Wall Street@-@s catcalls and the near-complete Republican rejection of Mr. Obama@-@s economic stimulus package add up to the depletion of his momentum. </s> <s> But it is too early to answer with much confidence. </s> <s> Presidential mojo is an elusive and ephemeral force that flows from many sources. </s> <s> It derives largely from numbers: the size of the election victory, the poll ratings, the breadth of partisan support in Congress. </s> <s> By those measures, Mr. Obama@-@s 53 percent popular vote majority, mid-60 percent job approval ratings, and solid House and Senate majorities compare favorably at this stage with the profile of any new president post-World War II. </s> <s> But the sustainability of those power gauges can be inversely related to the scale of the political challenges a president faces @-@ sometimes exhausting his capital in the first year of a White House term. </s> <s> The recession and two wars facing Mr. Obama easily match the stagflation and cold war challenges that confronted Ronald Reagan in 1981, and may exceed those of any predecessor since F. D. R. Moreover, presidential momentum can drain rapidly @-@ or replenish @-@ depending on unplanned events, often partly or entirely outside the president@-@s control. </s> <s> The belatedly disclosed tax problems that felled Mr. Daschle, and the about-face by Senator Gregg that ended his nomination for commerce secretary, only hint at the potential for off-script disruptions, which often come in the realm of foreign policy. </s> <s> The alchemy that translates those ingredients into presidential success defies consistent prediction. </s> <s> After John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Richard Nixon in 1960, Americans rallied behind him; his initial 72 percent job approval rating was the highest Gallup has recorded for a new president, before or since. </s> <s> Mr. Kennedy retained that high standing through his first 100 days, despite the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in April 1961. </s> <s> Yet the victories he achieved from a Democratic Congress remained modest. </s> <s> The rap on Kennedy was @-@too much profile, not enough courage,@-@ recalled the presidential scholar Fred Greenstein. </s> <s> Only after he was martyred in Dallas two years later did his proposals on civil rights sweep through Congress under his less-charismatic successor, Lyndon B. Johnson. </s> <s> Having lost the popular vote to Al Gore, George W. Bush entered the White House with far less political capital than Kennedy. </s> <s> And yet before summer he muscled through a closely divided Congress the income tax cuts that became the signature economic policy of his eight-year presidency. </s> <s> Four months later, the 9@-@11 attacks gave him enough standing eventually to take the nation to war against Iraq. </s> <s> By 2008, the difficulties of that endeavor had helped wipe out his influence with the public, Congress and both political parties. </s> <s> Entering office in 1993, Bill Clinton occupied a kind of middle ground in presidential sway. </s> <s> He ousted the incumbent, George H. W. Bush, in 1992, but split the @-@change@-@ vote with Ross Perot. </s> <s> An early furor over gays in the military drained away some of his political energy, as did the upending of his first two choices for attorney general. </s> <s> Later that year Mr. Clinton managed to win narrow approval of his economic plan, but his universal health care initiative collapsed, and discontented voters turned the House and Senate over to Republicans in 1994. </s> <s> One lesson for new presidents, in the words of Howard Paster, a Clinton White House lobbyist: @-@Congress swallows better in small bites. </s> <s> @-@ Yet the @-@crisis presidents@-@ to whom Mr. Obama is most appropriately compared don@-@t have the luxury of serving bite-size initiatives. </s> <s> In 1981, Ronald Reagan needed every bit of his political capital @-@ and a booster shot of good will from an assassination attempt @-@ to win his package of deep tax and budget cuts. </s> <s> @-@Reagan had great momentum, and even greater momentum after he came back from being shot,@-@ recalled his speechwriter Ken Khachigian. </s> <s> @-@Still, there was resistance. </s> <s> @-@ In Roosevelt@-@s case, it was the application of supple leadership skills to a public terrified of financial ruin that allowed him win all 15 items on his 100-days priority list; the Emergency Banking Act swept through the House by voice vote. </s> <s> In the whirl of action Roosevelt moved to end Prohibition by prodding Congress to legalize beer, which Mr. Alter called @-@one of the least appreciated elements of how F.

Bloomberg flatly ruled out an independent run for president in 2012. </s> <s> On Monday, he appeared at the national unveiling in New York of No Labels, a group that aspires to build a grass-roots

</s> <s> It@-@s also possible, though, that he understands something about the modern political culture that many of those speculating about the purpose of No Labels do not @-@ that an independent not

<s> After all, MoveOn.org and the Tea Party groups sprang up organically and in a decentralized way, embraced by angry citizens circulating online petitions and holding rallies. </s> <s> By contrast, No Labels was created by two Washington consultants, the Democratic fund-raiser Nancy Jacobson and the Republican image-shaper Mark McKinnon, and its slick opening event featured throngs of journalists, free boxed lunches and a song written for the occasion by the pop sensation Akon. </s> <s> The group@-@s slogan, printed on T-shirts and banners, summarizes its purpose this way: @-@Not

donor base already constitutes the major individual players who have historically given hundreds of millions of dollars to these types of efforts,@-@ Mr. Brock said. </s> <s> @-@They just need to be asked, and I have no doubt they will step up at this critical time. </s> <s> @-@There also seems to be widespread agreement among Democratic activists and donors on the need for such groups to be more heavily involved in the 2012 elections. </s> <s> White House officials have signaled in recent weeks that the Obama administration would not object to Democratic-leaning outside groups getting involved in the 2012 elections, a change from the Obama campaign@-@s attitude toward such groups in 2008. </s> <s> But they have also indicated that they would prefer that the names of donors be

those principles. </s> <s> Most political operatives agree that it is easier to raise money if the option of offering anonymity is available. </s> <s> @-@It would be sort of a funny principle to stand on, to essentially tie one hand behind your back,@-@ Mr. McKay said. </s> <s> Besides Mr. Brock, numerous Democratic activists have been in discussions about setting up similar independent efforts. </s> <s> On Monday, for instance, Steve Rosenthal, who was the chief executive of America Coming Together, a Democratic fund-raising vehicle that focused on voter mobilization in the 2004 election, convened a group of political operatives, many of whom were active in that election, at a Washington restaurant to discuss what might be done for 2012. </s> <s> No one, however, has apparently gone as

who is weighing a run for president in 2012, has an active political action committee in Alabama might seem puzzling. </s> <s> It is, after all, not a critical early-voting state for the Republican nomination, where these kinds of leadership PACs are often set up by potential presidential candidates. </s> <s> Upon closer inspection, though, Mr. Romney@-@s interest in Alabama snaps into focus. </s> <s> The state has among the most permissive campaign finance rules in the nation, allowing contributions of unlimited size from individuals and corporations. </s> <s> As a result, the Alabama affiliate of Mr. Romney@-@s federal PAC, Free and Strong America, has raised more than @-@440,000 this year, with many of the contributions amounting to tens of thousands of dollars each. </s> <s> Yet it has donated @-@21,500 @-@ less than 5 percent of what it has raised @-@ to state and local candidates in Alabama, for which these state PACs are ostensibly intended. </s> <s> @-@The PAC also contributed @-@3,500 to Nikki Haley@-@s successful campaign for governor in South Carolina. </s> <s> @-@ Instead, a vast majority of the just over @-@300,000 Mr. Romney@-@s Alabama PAC has reported spending this year has been directed back to the Boston headquarters of Free and Strong America, paying for, among other expenses, a significant part of the salaries of Mr. Romney@-@s political staff, who will almost certainly form the core of his presidential campaign if he decides to run. </s> <s> The financing Mr. Romney has used, leaning on not only his Alabama PAC but also on similar vehicles in other states, allows him to tiptoe around federal campaign finance limits. </s> <s> It also illustrates how potential candidates willing to be creative with the nation@-@s Rube Goldberg-like campaign finance system can manipulate it to their greatest benefit @-@ and Mr. Romney has been by far the most assertive in this approach among those believed to be weighing bids for the Republican nomination. </s> <s> Leadership PACs cannot, by law, be used to finance a presidential run, but they can distribute money to other candidates, help pay for travel and even finance the nucleus of a political operation. </s> <s> In the process, the PACs must be careful not to cross over into actually footing the bill for a presidential candidacy. </s> <s> Mr. Romney is testing these limitations, as are other potential 2012 contenders, like Gov. </s> <s> Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, who has set up state PACs in Iowa and New Hampshire, along with a federal PAC. </s> <s> But Mr. Romney has gone further in squeezing maximum legal advantage in other areas. </s> <s> It is generally illegal for a state-based PAC, like Mr. Romney@-@s Alabama affiliate, to finance activity geared toward federal elections. </s> <s> In other words, money raised by the state PAC is not supposed to be used for work on federal races, as opposed to contests at the state and local level. </s> <s> In his filings with the election commission, Mr. Romney is essentially contending that his leadership PAC@-@s work is divided evenly between federal and non-federal election activities and that the financing of administrative expenses is accordingly divided between the state and federal PACs. </s> <s> As a result, for example, roughly half the salary of Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney who was his traveling press secretary in his 2008 presidential run, is paid for by the federal PAC, while the rest is divided up by the state-based PACs Mr. Romney has set up in Alabama, Iowa, Michigan, New Hampshire and South Carolina. </s> <s> Not surprisingly, the PACs in the three states that do not cap donations to these kinds of organizations @-@ Alabama, Iowa and Michigan @-@ pay the largest parts of Mr. Fehrnstrom@-@s salary, as well other expenses of the federal committee, with the Alabama PAC assuming the biggest share. </s> <s> The Alabama entity has covered a little less than 20 percent of Mr. Fehrnstrom@-@s salary, which has totaled about @-@75,000, according to the most recent campaign finance filings available. </s> <s> It has provided a similar percentage of the roughly @-@50,000 that the PACs have reported paying this year to Matt Rhoades, the group@-@s executive director who was the 2008 Romney campaign@-@s research director, and paid Beth Myers, formerly Mr. Romney@-@s campaign manager, about 13 percent of the more than @-@75,000 in consulting fees she has taken in this year. </s> <s> Mr. Romney@-@s federal PAC has covered about 50 percent of their salaries, with the state PACs taking on the rest. </s> <s> In all, the state PACs have funneled more than @-@600,000 into Mr. Romney@-@s federal PAC, paying for half of the organization@-@s legal fees this year, which totaled @-@84,000; they have paid about 50 percent of the PAC@-@s office supply budget, which came to @-@4,000; they even picked up the tab on half of the @-@560 the PAC spent for paper shredding. </s> <s> Yet only about a third of the @-@1.1 million Mr. Romney@-@s PACs have together contributed to candidates has gone to those at the state or local level. </s> <s> By that indicator at least, Mr. Romney@-@s PACs appear decidedly more focused on federal races. </s> <s> Mr. Romney@-@s advisers, however, point out that about half the candidates they have supported have been in state and local races. </s> <s> Regardless, the election commission tends to give committees the benefit of the doubt on these kinds of questions, campaign finance lawyers said. </s> <s> @-@As a practical matter, they@-@re not going to question it,@-@ said Lawrence Noble, a former general counsel for the election commission and a lawyer at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher @-@ Flom. </s> <s> And Ben Ginsberg, the lawyer for Mr. Romney@-@s PAC, said that Mr. Romney had been doing this for several election cycles and that the election commission had never challenged the way the committee allocated its expenses. </s> <s> @-@It@-@s what the law allows us to do,@-@ Mr. Ginsberg said. </s> <s> The use of leadership PACs by potential presidential candidates is not new, but the elaborate architecture of state and federal PACs Mr. Romney has set up is unusual, campaign finance lawyers said. </s> <s> Mr. Romney leaned on a similar setup before his last presidential run as well. </s> <s> Having the

of spending also carries the potential of tripping over campaign finance laws. </s> <s> The outsize contributions are possible because while donations to federal PACs are limited to @-@5,000, many

just one aspect of the 2012 money race, which is well under way. </s> <s> In recent months, many of the candidates-in-waiting have been actively cultivating the kinds of major donors needed to finance expensive presidential bids. </s> <s> Mr. Romney has been by far the most assertive, according to interviews with a half-dozen top Republican fund-raisers, already pushing for commitments from major donors should he formally decide to run. </s> <s> Over the summer, Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, invited top bundlers of campaign checks from key states to his vacation home in New Hampshire on several occasions to help firm up their commitments. </s> <s> Mr. Romney has already lined up an array of prominent supporters, including a billionaire, David Koch, who has donated heavily to conservative causes over the years, and Robert Wood Johnson IV, the billionaire owner of the New York Jets and one of the party@-@s most coveted fund-raisers. </s> <s> Mr. Pawlenty has also been putting together a financial apparatus. </s> <s> On Monday and Tuesday evening, for instance, he met with top fund-raisers who flew to Minneapolis to listen to a briefing on his record as

moving to deepen those relationships with a potential eye on 2012, Mr. Strong said. </s> <s> Noticeably absent from the wooing for the most part has been the former Gov. </s> <s> Sarah Palin of Alaska, Republican fund-raisers said. </s> <s> She has raised large sums for her federal political action committee, Sarah PAC, this year @-@ exceeded only by Mr. Romney @-@ but largely through

the presidential campaign of Senator John McCain of Arizona and was among the attendees. </s> <s> Even with all of the jockeying, Republican fund-raisers and operatives said that commitments for 2012

partner at the Washington lobbying firm, Fierce, Isakowitz @-@ Blalock, who was a top fund-raiser for the McCain campaign. </s> <s> @-@People aren@-@t buying yet. </s> <s> @-@Many donors are awaiting decisions by potential 2012 candidates like Gov. </s> <s> Haley Barbour of Mississippi, who has been collecting giant checks in his capacity as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, which raised record amounts this year. </s> <s> The relationships he forged with deep-pocketed donors could double as useful building blocks for a presidential run. </s> <s> There is also Gov. </s> <s> Mitch Daniels of Indiana. </s> <s> He has said he will wait until the end of his state@-@s legislative session in April to make a decision, but he has held fund-raisers in recent months for his state-based leadership PAC, Aiming Higher, in Chicago, Washington and New York. </s> <s> He did four fund-raising events in New York alone. </s> <s> Senator John Thune of South Dakota, who is also contemplating entering the 2012 fray, has been sounding out top fund-raisers as well. </s> <s> Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, is one of the biggest variables. </s> <s> Mr. Gingrich has not been openly buttonholing major donors for a presidential bid, fund-raisers said. </s> <s> Nevertheless, all the work he has been doing for his policy center, American Solutions, generating large contributions @-@the group is permitted to take in donations of unlimited size@-@ and building donor lists, could form a strong financial foundation for a run. </s> <s> Top fund-raisers said they had observed relatively little effort so far on the part of former Gov. </s> <s> Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, whose leadership PAC fund-raising has trailed that of Mr. Romney, Ms. Palin and Mr. Pawlenty, to cozy up to major donors. </s> <s> His supporters, however, point out that his strength has always been more at the grass-roots level. </s> <s> Even with all of the uncertainty, some large donors have already made sizable investments with those who could wind up as presidential candidates. </s> <s> Mr. Barbour has banked several @-@25,000 contributions in recent months from Mississippi corporations, like Anderson Companies, a construction firm, and Ergon, which is involved in petroleum products, through Haley@-@s Leadership PAC, a committee he set up in Georgia, where there are few campaign finance restrictions. </s> <s> Richard Marriott, the hotel executive, and his wife, Donna, have together given Mr. Romney @-@225,000 this year mainly through the state-based affiliates of his federal PAC, Free and Strong America, in Alabama, Iowa, Michigan, New Hampshire and South Carolina. </s> <s> Other major Romney contributors include Edward Conard, a former executive with Mr. Romney at Bain Capital, who donated @-@100,000, and Hushang Ansary, a Texas oil-and-gas investor and former Iran finance minister, who contributed @-@95,000. </s> <s> The network of state PACs Mr. Romney has

the sense that government undermines individual responsibility; the observation that people who work hard get shafted while people who play influence games get the gravy. </s> <s> Obama will have to propose policies that re-establish the link between effort and reward. </s> <s> Fourth, Obama has to build an institutional structure to support a more moderate approach. </s> <s> Presidents come into office thinking that they will be able to go ahead and enact policies. </s> <s> Then they realize that they can only succeed if there is a vast phalanx of institutions laboring alongside them. </s> <s> Liberals already have institutions. </s> <s> To be a center-left leader, Obama will have to mobilize independent institutions as well. </s> <s> These don@-@t exist in Washington, but they do around the nation. </s> <s> Civic organizations, local business groups and municipal leagues run from Orlando to Kansas City to Seattle. </s> <s> These groups are filled with local leaders who lobby for balanced budgets, infrastructure plans and other worthy causes. </s> <s> If Obama can mobilize these groups, he would not only build coalitions, but he would help heal the venomous rift between the White House and business, which is a cancer on his presidency. </s> <s> Over the next few months, the Republicans will have their time in the sun. </s> <s> On Tuesday, I@-@ll offer some thoughts on how they can seize the moment. </s> <s> But if Obama is to rebound, he is going to have to suppress his natural competitive instincts. </s> <s> If he gets caught up in the Beltway fight club, the Republicans will emerge as the party of limited government and he@-@ll emerge as the spokesman for big government @-@ surely a losing proposition. </s> <s> Instead, he will have to go out and do his own thing. </s> <s> That means every day reinforcing the following narrative: the Republicans are only half right. </s> <s> They want to cut things;

more scientific research; a giant effort to improve Hispanic graduation rates; medical courts to rationalize the malpractice system and so on. </s> <s> Instead of being disjointed, as he has been, the president will have to reinforce this turnaround story day after day. </s> <s> @-@ The problem is not that America lacks resources. </s> <s> The problem is that they are misallocated. </s> <s> If Obama can establish credibility as someone who can cut and replace, Election Day 2012 will be rosier for him than Election Day 2010. </s> <s> Op-Ed ContributorsBy Barry C. Burden and Kenneth R. MayerMadison, Wis. ELECTION Day is nearly upon us, but for many voters it has already come and gone. </s> <s> States have aggressively expanded the use of early voting, allowing people to submit their ballots before Election Day in person, by mail and in voting centers set up in shopping malls and other public places. </s> <s> More than 30 percent of votes cast in the 2008 presidential race arrived before Election Day itself, double the amount in 2000. </s> <s> In 10 states, more than half of all votes were cast early, with some coming in more than a month before the election. </s> <s> Election Day as we know it is quickly becoming an endangered species. </s> <s> Early voting offers convenience and additional opportunities to cast a ballot. </s> <s> Common sense tells us that this should mean higher turnout. </s> <s> But a thorough look at the data shows that the opposite is true: early voting depresses turnout by several percentage points. </s> <s> Our research, conducted with our colleagues David Canon and Donald Moynihan at the University of Wisconsin, is based on a three-part statistical analysis of the 2008 presidential election. </s> <s> First, we analyzed voting patterns in each of the nation@-@s 3,100 counties to estimate the effect of early voting laws on turnout. </s> <s> We controlled for a wide range of demographic, geographic and political variables, like whether a county was in a battleground state. </s> <s> Controlling for all of the other factors thought to shape voter participation, our model showed that the availability of early voting reduced turnout in the typical county by three percentage points,. </s> <s> Consider, as an example, a county in Kentucky, which lacks early voting. </s> <s> If we compared this to a similar county in neighboring Tennessee, which permits early voting, we would observe, other things being equal, turnout that was 3 points lower. </s> <s> Next, we studied the data on more than 70,000 voters and nonvoters from the Census Bureau@-@s Current Population Survey, which asks respondents whether they voted. </s> <s> Once again, we employed a statistical model to control for demographic variables like education and race as well as geographic and political factors. </s> <s> The model showed that an individual living in a state with early voting had a probability of voting that was four points lower than a comparable voter in a state without early voting. </s> <s> Third, we took advantage of a useful feature of the census survey, which asks individuals whether they voted early or on Election Day. </s> <s> We examined the characteristics of voters and nonvoters, and found that the profiles of early voters and election day voters were mostly similar. </s> <s> With one big exception: our model forecast that early voters had profiles that made them two percentage points more likely to vote than Election Day voters, whether there was an early option or not. </s> <s> Early voters were more educated and older and had higher incomes, all traits associated with a higher probability of voting. </s> <s> A probability difference of 2 percentage points may seem like a trivial figure, but when applied to populations of millions, it can shift national and state elections. </s> <s> Even with all of the added convenience and easier opportunities to cast ballots, turnout not only doesn@-@t increase with early voting, it actually falls. </s> <s> How can this be? </s> <s> The answer lies in the nature of voter registration laws, and the impact of early voting on mobilization efforts conducted by parties and other groups on Election Day. </s> <s> In most states, registration and voting take place in two separate steps. </s> <s> A voter must first register, sometimes a month before the election, and then return another time to cast a ballot. </s> <s> Early voting by itself does not eliminate this two-step requirement. </s> <s> For voters who missed their registration deadline, the convenience of early voting is irrelevant. </s> <s> Early voting also dilutes the intensity of Election Day. </s> <s> When a large share of votes is cast well in advance of the first Tuesday in November, campaigns begin to scale back their late efforts. </s> <s> The parties run fewer ads and shift workers to more competitive states. </s> <s> Get-out-the-vote efforts in particular become much less efficient when so many people have already voted. </s> <s> When Election Day is merely the end of a long voting period, it lacks the sort of civic stimulation that used to be provided by local news media coverage and discussion around the water cooler. </s> <s> Fewer co-workers will be sporting @-@I voted@-@ stickers on their lapels on Election Day. </s> <s> Studies have shown that these informal interactions have a strong effect on turnout, as they generate social pressure. </s> <s> With significant early voting, Election Day can become a kind of afterthought, simply the last day of a drawn-out slog. </s> <s> Fortunately, there is a way to improve turnout and keep the convenience of early voting. </s> <s> Our research shows that when early voting is combined with same-day registration @-@ that is, you can register to vote and cast an early ballot on the same day @-@ the depressive effect of early voting disappears. </s> <s> North Carolina and Vermont, two otherwise very different states that combined early voting with same-day registration, had turnout levels in 2008 that were much higher than the overall national figure of 58 percent of the voting-age population. </s> <s> Turnouts in Vermont and North Carolina were, respectively, 63 percent and 64 percent. </s> <s> Allowing Election-Day registration, in which voters can register at the polling place, has the same effect. </s> <s> Our models show that the simple presence of Election-Day registration in states like Minnesota and New Hampshire increases turnout by more than six points. </s> <s> By removing barriers that require potential voters to register weeks before a campaign reaches its height, less-engaged citizens can enter the voting process late @-@ and political campaigns can respond by maintaining the intensity of their efforts through Election Day. </s> <s> The implications for policymakers are obvious. </s> <s> Adopting a form of @-@one-stop shopping@-@ facilitates a larger and more representative set of voters. </s> <s> Early voting may be the most popular reform sweeping across the states, but it alone is not the key to raising voter turnout. </s> <s> Political TimesBy Matt BaiThere@-@s a reason that President Obama decided to broadcast his meeting with college students on the Internet on Tuesday night, taking sympathetic questions by way of Facebook and Skype and Twitter. </s> <s> @-@About the only hip thing the president didn@-@t try was to break out the Guitar Hero and start playing @-@Revolution. </s> <s> @-@ The midterm campaign has now entered its final phase, and Mr. Obama is focusing his attention on the younger voters and volunteers he inspired in 2008. </s> <s> For Mr. Obama, re-engaging Organizing for America, or O.

Cu@-@ is running for governor of Oaxaca State as the candidate for so many parties that his campaign is handing out a pamphlet explaining how to mark the ballot. </s> <s> In simple cartoons, the drawings promise voters that Mr. Cu@-@ will kick out the party that has governed Oaxaca for 80 years and clean up the state. </s> <s> A decade ago, Mexico ended more than 70 years of control by the Institutional Revolutionary Party and elected an opposition president. </s> <s> But in Oaxaca, the PRI, as the party is known, has held fast through a vast party machine that dispenses patronage and often seems accountable to no one except the governor. </s> <s> The other parties believe that the only way to dislodge the PRI here is to unite across ideological lines against it. </s> <s> Mr. Cu@-@ is the candidate for a coalition of the conservative National Action Party and the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, along with a couple of small parties. </s> <s> Four years ago, the idea of the left and right@-@s joining forces would have seemed inconceivable. </s> <s> The two sides fought an extremely bitter, prolonged battle over the presidency, while the PRI appeared relegated to irrelevance. </s> <s> But since then, the PRI has roared back, advancing in state races and recovering its lost ground in last year@-@s midterm elections. </s> <s> On Sunday, voters in 12, or about a third, of Mexico@-@s states will vote for new governors. </s> <s> In six of those, the National Action Party and the Party of the Democratic Revolution are running as a coalition, and polls show that Oaxaca is one of only a couple of states where they could unseat the PRI. </s> <s> In the final week of the campaign, all of Mexico was shaken by the murder of the front-runner from the PRI in the northern state of Tamaulipas, presumably by drug cartels. </s> <s> But elsewhere, campaigning has continued unabated. </s> <s> To the party strategists in Mexico City, a win by Mr. Cu@-@ in Oaxaca will prove that a coalition is the best way to stop a return to the presidency by the PRI in the 2012 election. </s> <s> The PRI has recovered @-@ with an effective majority in the lower house of Congress and in state offices @-@ through its rivals@-@ mistakes, said Daniel Lund, a Mexico City pollster and political analyst. </s> <s> The left has been divided, and President Felipe Calder@-@n@-@s conservative party has lost ground amid the sluggish economy and the spiraling violence of the drug war. </s> <s> The PRI has come back @-@by simply enduring and offering a vision of what was and what might be,@-@ Mr. Lund said. </s> <s> The front-runner for the 2012 presidential race is Enrique Pe@-@a Nieto, the PRI governor of Mexico State, the populous state surrounding Mexico City. </s> <s> But if the PRI candidate were to lose the state next year to a coalition candidate when Mr. Pe@-@a Nieto@-@s term expires, it could destroy his Teflon image. </s> <s> That explains why

Cruz Santiago, 66, a farmer. </s> <s> Mr. Cu@-@s supporters reserve their criticism for Oaxaca@-@s powerful departing governor, Ulises Ruiz. </s> <s> Analysts say he has maintained almost feudal control through a mix of favors and violence. </s> <s> The state is still scarred by a 2006 uprising against Mr. Ruiz by teachers and left-wing social groups that shut down Oaxaca City for months and led to more than a dozen deaths. </s> <s> In the months before the election, Oaxaca has been marked by political violence, including the April deaths of a Mexican peace activist and a Finnish observer traveling to support an Indian village that has been in conflict with neighboring villages. </s> <s> A small-town mayor and a council member were killed last month in a confrontation over a mine. </s> <s> On Wednesday, another mayor and a council member from a Pacific coast town were shot and killed. </s> <s> Sergio Aguayo, a political analyst at the Colegio de M@-@xico in Mexico City, said that corruption in Oaxaca was so entrenched that he was skeptical that Mr. Cu@-@ would be able to make many changes if he won. </s> <s> @-@Will he have the capacity for a major reform in Oaxaca, or will he be engulfed by the system? </s> <s> @-@ Mr. Aguayo asked. </s> <s> Esther Santiago L@-@pez, 27, a Mixtec Indian woman with two children, said she had supported Mr. Cu@-@ until he allied with the

in an interview. </s> <s> @-@For Oaxaca, this vote represents the possibility to break with the old authoritarian PRI that tries to remain in power through antidemocratic methods. </s> <s> @-@ Still,

It@-@s that sense of @-@We@-@ll get that done right after we have dealt with everything else@-@ that makes me so angry. </s> <s> The world is not an expendable resource; fixing the damage you have inflicted will be the issue for my generation. </s> <s> It is that simple. </s> <s> @-@TONY Well, I am 62 and I did vote for Barack Obama. </s> <s> I held out no great hopes. </s> <s> It was clear from the outset that this was someone who would concede rather than confront @-@ and that@-@s a shortcoming in a politician, if not in a man. </s> <s> We have seen the consequences: not in the Middle East, nor in economic regulation, nor over detainees, nor in immigration reform has Mr. Obama followed through. </s> <s> The audacity of hope? </s> <s> As for the corporations, we baby boomers were right to be cynical. </s> <s> Like Goldman Sachs, oil companies are not benign economic agents, serving a need and taking a cut. </s> <s> They are, in Theodore Roosevelt@-@s words, @-@malefactors of great wealth. </s> <s> @-@ But our cynicism dulled our response to truly criminal behavior: @-@They would do that, wouldn@-@t they? </s> <s> @-@ It is one thing to watch while Goldman Sachs pillages the economy, quite another to be invited to stand aside while BP violates the Gulf Coast. </s> <s> Yes, we should be a lot angrier than we are. </s> <s> We are staring into our future and it does not work. </s> <s> The gush of filth is a reminder that we have surrendered our independence to a technology we cannot master. </s> <s> Our energies are misdirected to expensive foreign wars whose purposes grow ever more obscure. </s> <s> We rail at one another in @-@cultural@-@ clashes irrelevant to our real problems. </s> <s> Meanwhile, the clockwork precision of our classical constitution has ground to a halt @-@ depending as it does on a consensus that no longer exists. </s> <s> Taking the long view, this is how republics die. </s> <s> @-@Someone@-@ clearly has to do @-@something. </s> <s> @-@ What do you propose? </s> <s> @-@DANIEL Just as you are too forgiving of unacceptable corporate behavior, maybe you are too resigned politically. </s> <s> To actually effect change, you need to come in thinking that real change is possible. </s> <s> My generation saw things that way; that is why so many young people supported Mr. Obama. </s> <s> Perhaps more than any other constituency in the United States, we believed that engagement would make things happen. </s> <s> But the more we are told that crises are to be expected and cannot be prevented by those in power @-@ that we must put our faith in God, as the president advised on Tuesday @-@ the more our faith in government slips away. </s> <s> Politicians depend on the public: given a strong enough consensus, they will act. </s> <s> That@-@s what I would have had you do @-@ and that@-@s what we have to do now: build a consensus and act. </s> <s> Your generation talked a lot about engagement. </s> <s> So engage. </s> <s> Use the lever of public opinion to force strong environmental legislation. </s> <s> In reconciling ourselves after BP to @-@getting back to normal,@-@ we will have missed a vital opportunity. </s> <s> We need a new @-@normal. </s> <s> @-@ And we need to ask ourselves new questions: not whether we can afford to invest in a different way of life @-@ solar energy, mass transportation, the phasing out of our dependency on oil @-@ but how long we can afford not to. </s> <s> You owe us this. </s> <s> @-@TONY I am a little queasy about all this generation talk. </s> <s> After all, I am the same age as Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, but I take no responsibility for them. </s> <s> Actually, while I agree that we need to build a national consensus, I don@-@t think the challenge is to convince Americans about pollution or even climate change. </s> <s> Nor is it just a matter of getting them to make sacrifices for the future. </s> <s> The challenge is to convince them once again of how much they could do if they came together. </s> <s> But that requires leadership @-@ and I can@-@t help noticing that you rather let the president off the hook. </s> <s> After all, if you and your contemporaries have lost faith in the man and @-@the system,@-@ that@-@s partly his fault. </s> <s> But you, too, have a responsibility. </s> <s> Coming together to elect someone is not enough, if you then go back to texting and Twittering. </s> <s> You have to stay together, know what you want and fight for it. </s> <s> It won@-@t work the first time and it won@-@t work perfectly, but you can@-@t give up. </s> <s> That, too, is politics. </s> <s> You are wrong to think that I have lost faith in government. </s> <s> Big government built this country. </s> <s> Without it there would have been no transcontinental railroad. </s> <s> Land-grant colleges @-@ the glory of American public education @-@ were the work of the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890. </s> <s> The nation invested substantial sums of money for the public good: remember the Marshall Plan, the G. I. </s> <s> Bill and the Interstate highways, without which our postwar economy could never have boomed as it did. </s> <s> And don@-@t forget the Civil Rights Act: a hugely controversial moral revolution that took great political courage. </s> <s> I have not lost faith in government @-@ but I worry about whether today@-@s politicians are up to the challenge. </s> <s> @-@DANIEL You@-@re right @-@ I do let the president off a little. </s> <s> But to have so many young people help elect a government after years of skepticism is no small feat. </s> <s> He almost single-handedly instilled political vigor in those of us who knew only shame over the previous administration. </s> <s> Without that surge of hope and thirst for action it is very possible that most members of my generation would have abandoned politics in disgust before they even began. </s> <s> For that mobilization, we have Mr. Obama to thank. </s> <s> Of course he deserves criticism. </s> <s> But what we must not do @-@ both as a generation and as a nation @-@ is to let our disillusion devolve into pessimism and laziness. </s> <s> What we now face is a moral challenge from which we cannot back down. </s> <s> I was afraid that in your skepticism you had lost faith and given up @-@ you have to admit that the radicalism of your generation never quite lived up to its potential. </s> <s> You always say that politics is @-@the art of the possible@-@: but if we could turn our anger into positive action, then surely the possible becomes a whole lot more probable. </s> <s> Is anger a wise guide to action? </s> <s> Admittedly, if used for the wrong causes or taken the wrong way, it can be disastrous. </s> <s> But isn@-@t it better than sitting back and complaining while we are led over the edge? </s> <s> @-@TONY Yes, it is not beyond us to sacrifice in the present for long-term advantage, to set aside the pursuit of quarterly economic growth as the supreme goal of public policy. </s> <s> We offer ourselves easy choices @-@ high taxation or free markets @-@ and are then surprised to learn that they do not speak to our needs. </s> <s> Technological fixes are the hubris of our time. </s> <s> But as the folks at BP have helpfully demonstrated, there is a limit to how many caps you can put on a leak; sometimes you need to start afresh. </s> <s> The challenge goes beyond oil slicks and moral revulsion. </s> <s> In the bigger picture, big oil has no long-term future: sooner or later the contemptible little sheikdoms that have arisen upon a pool of liquid greed will sink back into the desert. </s> <s> But why should BP and the emirs script the endgame? </s> <s> Nothing manmade is inevitable: Chinese capitalism @-@ unregulated profit accompanied by serial environmental catastrophe @-@ is not the only possible future. </s> <s> The president spoke on Tuesday of pressing forward with Congressional legislation. </s> <s> But at the moment that amounts to little more than @-@cap and trade@-@: a shell game for corporations that has been tried in Europe and already been found wanting. </s> <s> What we need is a Marshall Plan for the 50 states. </s> <s> Federal money raised from defense savings and, yes, taxes @-@ a loan to our successors @-@ should be made available on condition it is spent on public infrastructure, mass transit, renewable energy and education. </s> <s> Anything less is unworthy of the crisis that a 60,000-barrel-a-day leak has unleashed. </s> <s> Are you up to it? </s> <s> If you want to change the world, you had better be willing to fight for a long time. </s> <s> And there will be sacrifices. </s> <s> Do you really care enough or are you just offended at disturbing pictures? </s> <s> @-@DANIEL We have no choice but to care enough. </s> <s> The sacrifices you foresee are nothing compared to the ones we will be forced to make if we sit back and wait. </s> <s> Most important, we don@-@t have the luxury of fighting for a long time. </s> <s> Look, we are powerless and will be for a while to come. </s> <s> In fact, we are in the worst possible position: we are old enough to understand better than you what has to be done, but far too young to do it. </s> <s> All we can do is say it. </s> <s> By Jeff ZelenyWASHINGTON @-@ The Republican Party selected Tampa, Fla., on Wednesday as the site of its 2012 presidential nominating convention, with the city winning out over Phoenix and Salt Lake City as the place to kick off the party@-@s quest to defeat President Obama. </s> <s> Tampa was a leading contender in 2004 and 2008, but it lost out to New York City and Minneapolis-St. Paul. </s> <s> This time, Tampa was considered the odds-on favorite, considering the state@-@s big role in presidential elections. </s> <s> @-@Each convention is an important time in our party and nation@-@s history, and 2012 will certainly be no different,@-@ said Marco Rubio, a rising Republican figure and the party@-@s candidate for United States Senate from Florida. </s> <s> The Republican convention is scheduled to begin Aug. 27, 2012, and will be followed a week later by the Democratic Party convention. </s> <s> Democrats have not disclosed their list of prospective cities, but officials say applications are under review from several places, including Charlotte, N.

Paulson Jr., then the Treasury secretary. </s> <s> President George W. Bush was @-@poorly informed and detached,@-@ the book says. </s> <s> But Mr. Obama, who had read Mr. Paulson@-@s plan and copious amounts of related material, stepped into the breach. </s> <s> He gave a cogent overview of the crisis and declared that the Democrats were close to agreement with Mr. Paulson on a deal to approve the bailout. </s> <s> @-@ When he was done, Mr. Alter reports, @-@a Republican sitting some distance down the long table whispered to a pair of Democratic senators, @-@Everyone here is ready to vote for Obama, including the Republicans. </s> <s> @-@ The anecdote is one of scores of compelling insider accounts in @-@The Promise,@-@ an impressively reported, myth-debunking and timely combination of journalism and history. </s> <s> Drawing on interviews with more than 200 people, including Mr. Obama and virtually all principals of the White House staff, Mr. Alter seeks to answer three broad questions: What happened in Year One? </s> <s> What is President Obama @-@whom he calls @-@professor in chief@-@ really like? </s> <s> And how has he performed so far? </s> <s> @-@ Mr. Alter is well suited to pursue what he conceded was an ambitious goal, before the ink was very dry on Mr. Obama@-@s initial series of executive orders and bill signatures. </s> <s> A senior editor at Newsweek, Mr. Alter was the author of @-@The Defining Moment: F. D. R.@-@s Hundred Days and the Triumph of Hope,@-@ a best seller about the first months of Franklin D. Roosevelt@-@s presidency during the Great Depression, a time with obvious parallels to the present. </s> <s> Mr. Alter, who is also a correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC, customarily focuses on politics. </s> <s> But he does a commendable job of clarifying the complex economic issues Mr. Obama faced before and after the 2008 election. </s> <s> While @-@The Promise@-@ duly @-@ and somewhat dully @-@ addresses topics like the president@-@s personality and his off-hours recreational basketball games, the real meat of the book is about the execution of Mr. Obama@-@s stimulus package, the bank bailouts, health care overhaul and efforts at job creation. </s> <s> Mr. Alter gives the president high marks, but with qualifications. </s> <s> He notes that Mr. Obama has presided over roughly @-@1.5 trillion in government outlays @-@the @-@700 billion authorized by Mr. Bush@-@s TARP program, as well as @-@800 billion in stimulus spending@-@. </s> <s> And look at some of the results: When Mr. Obama took office in January 2009, the book notes, the economy was shrinking and losing 741,000 jobs a month. </s> <s> By January 2010, the economy was growing at a nearly 6 percent pace and losing about 20,000 jobs a month. </s> <s> In the interim, banks paid back most of their @-@700 billion bailout. </s> <s> The author says Mr. Obama hasn@-@t received the public credit he deserves for engineering an economic turnaround while simultaneously effecting major social initiatives. </s> <s> Along with health care overhaul, Mr. Alter says, the accomplishments include @-@the biggest tax cuts for the middle class since Reagan, the biggest infrastructure bill@-@ since the interstate highway law, @-@the biggest education bill since Lyndon Johnson@-@s first federal aid to education, the biggest scientific and medical research investment in 40 years, and the biggest clean energy bill ever@-@ @-@all in the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act@-@. </s> <s> Mr. Obama@-@s own political strategies are partly to blame for this lack of recognition, the author says. </s> <s> @-@The White House didn@-@t want the public thinking that Obama had achieved long-sought public policy objectives under the guise of merely stimulating the economy,@-@ he writes, @-@even though that@-@s exactly what had happened.@-@MR. </s> <s> ALTER provides ample evidence that Mr. Obama is not a @-@socialist,@-@ as contended by some conservative commentators. </s> <s> The author describes at length how the president acceded to recommendations from Timothy F.

Kennedy. </s> <s> But on a rereading, it is Kennedy@-@s defeated Democratic rival Hubert Humphrey who emerges as the most interesting and misunderstood figure. </s> <s> White includes a remarkable scene just before the West Virginia primary, which doomed Humphrey@-@s candidacy. </s> <s> The candidate is in a diner when a staff member bolts in to tell him he will lose his TV time if he doesn@-@t pay the local station immediately. </s> <s> Humphrey, no longer the happy warrior, shouts: @-@Pay it! </s> <s> I don@-@t care how, don@-@t come to me with that kind of story! </s> <s> @-@ Then, White writes, @-@realizing that his crestfallen aide was, like himself, destitute, Hubert pulled out his checkbook at the breakfast table and said, @-@All right, I@-@ll pay for it myself,@-@ and scribbled a personal check of his own. </s> <s> @-@ White adds: @-@Mrs. Humphrey watched him do so, with dark, sad eyes, and one had the feeling that the check was money from the family grocery fund @-@ or the money earmarked to pay for the wedding of their daughter, who was to be married the week following the primary. </s> <s> @-@ White@-@s empathy for Humphrey, outspent and outsmarted by a rich man who had @-@never known hunger,@-@ is palpable. </s> <s> The power of the scene derives not only from its candor but also from its placement within a superbly structured narrative. </s> <s> Even though the reader knows the outcome, there is tension throughout, beginning when Kennedy arrives at the family compound in Hyannis Port on election night. </s> <s> He watches the results on TV until 3:40 a.m., when it is still too close to call, then grabs a sandwich. </s> <s> He complains that there is no milk in the house, only beer, then goes to bed, unsure whether he has lost or won. </s> <s> Moments like this, so vivid and spontaneous, give White the room to expand his story and fit in, among other things, a useful 32-page primer on the history of American politics. </s> <s> White was writing at a time when television was just becoming the medium through which most Americans experienced political campaigns, though in a limited way. </s> <s> Much of the action still took place off camera, which enabled a respected journalist like White to gain direct but unpublicized access to the candidates as well as to their families and members of their staffs, who spoke openly about their hopes and ambitions. </s> <s> That is no longer the case. </s> <s> The ubiquity of the camera and the microphone has created instead the ersatz theater of the tightly scripted campaign, with candidates kept on message and reporters kept at bay. </s> <s> In fact, the change would come quite quickly. </s> <s> By 1968, the slick exteriors of campaigns, buffed by high-priced advertising, made it ever more difficult for journalists to penetrate the mysterious inner workings of elections. </s> <s> This mystery is the subject of @-@The Selling of the President. </s> <s> @-@ McGinniss had the ingenious idea to slice off the part of politics that television hadn@-@t covered and probably couldn@-@t: the ad men and the role they played in the transformation of politics by the 60-second commercial. </s> <s> Since the Humphrey campaign denied McGinniss access to its advertising team, he covered Richard Nixon@-@s. It turned out for the best since it enabled McGinniss to introduce to the world a sophisticated ad man named Roger Ailes. </s> <s> The result is a book surprisingly free of the cynicism implied in its title. </s> <s> McGinniss instead conveys the excitement of discovery. </s> <s> His portrait of Nixon@-@s struggle to master the alien art of being likable is drawn with sympathetic humor: @-@He was afraid of television. </s> <s> He knew his soul was hard to find. </s> <s> Beyond that, he considered it a gimmick; its use in politics offended him. </s> <s> It had not been part of the game when he had learned to play, he could see no reason to bring it in now. </s> <s> He half-suspected it was an Eastern liberal trick: one more way to make him look silly. </s> <s> It offended his sense of dignity, one of the truest senses he had. </s> <s> @-@ It struck me, as I reread these older books, that they were all written before Watergate, at a time when many still considered politics an honorable, even noble, calling, populated by larger-than-life figures who inspired genuine affection even from journalists. </s> <s> It is plain to the reader that White and McGinniss both love politics. </s> <s> Of course, Heilemann and Halperin love politics too @-@Heilemann has written first-rate political essays in New York magazine, and Halperin, Time@-@s senior political analyst, invented The Note, an addictive e-mail dispatch that prefigured Politico@-@. </s> <s> But in @-@Game Change@-@ too many of the candidates and their aides come across as knaves or fools, with the exception of Obama and his team, and even these skilled players remain remote as people. </s> <s> Again, the contrast with the 1968 election is striking. </s> <s> Jules Witcover was a member of the press posse that covered Robert Kennedy@-@s brief, belated and intense run for the Democratic nomination. </s> <s> Some journalists who covered @-@Bobby@-@ became so enamored of him and his antiwar and pro-civil-rights positions that they began to question their own objectivity. </s> <s> A few even asked their editors to take them off the campaign bus. </s> <s> Witcover stayed aboard it without losing credibility; @-@85 Days@-@ presents strong criticism of the candidate@-@s missteps and candidly reports on the internal rough-and-tumble, including an incident in which the organizer Dick Tuck physically attacked a reporter. </s> <s> At the same time, Witcover vividly captures Kennedy@-@s rare gift for touching so many voters, and shows what it was really like to be a reporter following a wild and ultimately tragic campaign trail. </s> <s> When his car inched through Los Angeles @-@the hands reached up and out @-@ black and brown and white hands,@-@ Witcover writes, @-@young and old, and faces upturned, some of them calling encouragement, others seeming to try to convey it with their looks of adoration, or simple gladness. </s> <s> @-@ This short book has much to say not only about Kennedy but about the tumultuous mood of the country in the only recent election that possibly equaled the 2008 campaign in excitement and importance. </s> <s> The 814 pages of @-@An American

Change. </s> <s> @-@ In a particularly vivid scene, George Wallace momentarily forgets that his wife, Lurleen, has just died, and tries to dial their home in Montgomery. </s> <s> His hands start shaking and his face turns ashen when he realizes he no longer has anyone to tell about his day. </s> <s> If empathy is what@-@s most glaringly absent from @-@Game Change,@-@ @-@What It Takes,@-@ Richard Ben Cramer@-@s almost Freudian study of the lives and thoughts of the 1988 presidential candidates, is almost too indulgent toward its subjects. </s> <s> @-@I have tried to tell their stories in two ways @-@ as fairly as I could from the outside,@-@ Cramer writes, @-@and as empathetically as I could from behind their eyes. </s> <s> In doing so, I have tried not only to show them, but to show what our politics is like @-@ what it feels like to run for president; what it requires from them; what it builds in them; what it strips, or rips, from them. </s> <s> @-@ This approach turns out to be both original and revelatory. </s> <s> The first time I read the book, in 1992, the depictions of Bob Dole and Richard Gephardt, both all-American archetypes, made the strongest impression on me. </s> <s> On a second reading, the pages on Gary Hart assume great force. </s> <s> When Cramer describes the implosion of Hart@-@s campaign over allegations of marital infidelities @-@ including his dalliance aboard a boat called @-@Monkey Business@-@ @-@ the reader actually can imagine what Hart must have felt in those weeks when he was hounded by the media hordes. </s> <s> As Cramer explores this episode, which preceded the salacious revelations in the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings @-@and the Monica Lewinsky scandal@-@, his ambivalence is clear, even if Hart had dared the media to find examples of his reputed womanizing. </s> <s> Contrast this with @-@Game Change,@-@ with its unapologetically lurid account of Edwards@-@s cruelty to his family, especially his wife, who was terminally ill with cancer. </s> <s> So was Garry Wills correct, after all, about the demise of the modern campaign book? </s> <s> It seems unfair to place the entire burden of proof on @-@Game Change,@-@ particularly since there have been two other important books about the 2008 election, @-@Renegade,@-@ by Richard Wolffe, who covered the campaign for Newsweek, and @-@The Battle for America 2008,@-@ by Dan Balz of The Washington Post and Haynes Johnson @-@formerly of The Post@-@. </s> <s> It was Obama himself who suggested to Wolffe that he try to write a White-style narrative, offering special access. </s> <s> Wolffe@-@s book provides a fine portrait of the candidate but is told almost entirely from inside the Obama campaign bubble, and it lacks the narrative tension and rich portrayal of rival candidates that are hallmarks of earlier political books. </s> <s> Like Heilemann and Halperin, Wolffe views the campaign as a great sporting contest. </s> <s> @-@Indeed, Chapter 6 is titled @-@Game Changer. </s> <s> @-@Overlap is perhaps inevitable in multiple books on an already overreported campaign. </s> <s> A few of the choice anecdotes in @-@Game Change@-@ appeared earlier in @-@The Battle for America 2008. </s> <s> @-@ Its authors, both respected, veteran Washington political correspondents, clearly lacked the public relations skills of the @-@Game Change@-@ team, and so got less attention and smaller sales. </s> <s> Their book, like Wolffe@-@s, more closely resembles the earlier classics. </s> <s> They feel slow-cooked and are based on reporting gleaned from

Bush, after his re-election in 2004 but before the Democratic takeover of 2006, saw signature proposals crushed by their own parties@-@ formidable majorities. </s> <s> Bill Clinton was headed pretty

deals to remake welfare and balance the budget, goals to which he had long been committed but that stood little chance while his own party was in charge. </s> <s> Americans like their presidents most when they seem like grown-ups, the kind of people who can forge consensus from cacophony. </s> <s> We tend to get behind an executive who acts as a bulwark against ideological extremism or who has to persuade some opponents to help enact an agenda rather than one who seems, fairly or not, to be trying to ram it through. </s> <s> This is, of course, exactly the kind of statesmanlike president Obama envisioned becoming. </s> <s> As a candidate he indicted the unshakable orthodoxies of both parties and the ossified culture of Washington. </s> <s> But the breadth of the majorities Obama inherited has in some ways made it harder, rather than easier, for him to impose his vision on the capital. </s> <s> For one thing, the expectations for his presidency have been unreasonably high from the moment he took office, meaning that the mundane realities of governance could only disappoint an anxious country. </s> <s> When Al Franken became the 60th Democratic vote, for instance, pundits declared that Obama now had the power to pass any economic or health care plan he wanted @-@ despite the fact that holding 60 senators together on any one vote is like trying to organize the Gosselin

chambers, while his pledge to reform @-@business as usual@-@ went largely unfulfilled. </s> <s> Sullen Republicans, meanwhile, answering to a narrower slice of the electorate, have seen little reason to do anything other than reflexively attack the Democratic agenda at every turn. </s> <s> Liberal skeptics might argue that Republicans would shun Obama no matter how many seats they controlled, but the laws of political self-interest suggest otherwise; the more districts and states you represent, the more varied your constituencies and the more self-interest compels you to compromise. </s> <s> @-@The newly elected Scott Brown, for example, may sound like Rush Limbaugh now, but when the furor of the moment subsides and the polls on issues start rolling in from Massachusetts, he may find the Tea Party thing harder to sustain. </s> <s> @-@ A dialogue between Obama and a more powerful Republican minority on health care, for instance, might yield a bill that included deeper cost cuts and some kind of meaningful malpractice reform. </s> <s> And if a bill like that received more support from independent voters, moderate Republicans would be reluctant to oppose it. </s> <s> Chastened by the defeat in Massachusetts, Obama now has the better part of a year to stabilize his party@-@s standing. </s> <s> Perhaps that means he will, at long last, take his case directly to the voters rather than focusing all his energy on Capitol Hill, obsessing over every parliamentary maneuver and wavering member of Congress. </s> <s> The other bit of good news for the president, though, is that should the voters reject his argument and shear his Democratic majorities in November, at least he@-@ll be handed a valuable strategic foil in 2012. </s> <s> After all, running against the small-minded obstructionist forces in Congress has proved to be the most effective re-election pitch for a long line of beleaguered presidents, from Harry Truman to Bill Clinton. </s> <s> Losing his advantage in

to cook for British colonials, and then traveled with British troops to Burma, bringing back their Western clothes and ways to his village. </s> <s> In Selma, Obama claimed that his father was the beneficiary of the civil rights movement because it made the American government bring Kenyans, including his father, to the United States: @-@So the Kennedys decided we@-@re going to do an airlift. </s> <s> We@-@re going to go to Africa and start bringing young Africans over to this country. </s> <s> @-@ Remnick proves that the airlift was an idea for the improvement of Kenya, conceived and

mother whose son campaigned for him but was now looking for work. </s> <s> Even Shepard Fairey, the artist who made the iconic multihued @-@Hope@-@ poster, says he@-@s losing hope. </s> <s> Perhaps that should have come as no surprise. </s> <s> When Obama secured the Democratic nomination in June 2008, he told an admiring crowd that someday @-@we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless; this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal; this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last, best hope on earth. </s> <s> @-@I read that line to Obama and asked how his high-flying rhetoric sounded in these days of low-flying governance. </s> <s> @-@It sounds ambitious,@-@ he agreed. </s> <s> @-@But you know what? </s> <s> We@-@ve made progress on each of those fronts. </s> <s> @-@ He quoted Mario Cuomo@-@s line about campaigning in poetry and governing in prose. </s> <s> @-@But the prose and the poetry match up,@-@ he said. </s> <s> @-@It would be very hard for people to look back and say, You know what, Obama didn@-@t do what he@-@s promised. </s> <s> I think they could say, On a bunch of fronts he still has an incomplete. </s> <s> But I keep a checklist of what we committed to doing, and we@-@ve probably accomplished 70 percent of the things that we talked about during the campaign. </s> <s> And I hope as long as I@-@m president, I@-@ve got a chance to work on the other 30 percent. </s> <s> @-@But save the planet? </s> <s> If you promise to save the planet, might people think you would, you know, actually save the planet? </s> <s> He laughed, before shifting back to hope and inspiration. </s> <s> @-@I make no apologies for having set high expectations for myself and for the country, because I think we can meet those expectations,@-@ he said. </s> <s> @-@Now, the one thing that I will say @-@ which I anticipated and can be tough @-@ is the fact that in a big, messy democracy like this, everything takes time. </s> <s> And we@-@re not a culture that@-@s built on patience. </s> <s> @-@These days, Obama has been seeking guidance in presidential biographies. </s> <s> He is reading, among others, @-@The Clinton Tapes,@-@ Taylor Branch@-@s account of his secret interviews with Bill Clinton during the eight years of his presidency. </s> <s> @-@I was looking over some chronicles of the Clinton years,@-@ Obama told me, @-@and was reminded that in @-@94 @-@ when President Clinton@-@s poll numbers were lower than mine, and obviously the election ended up being bad for Democrats @-@ unemployment was only 6.6 percent. </s> <s> And I don@-@t think anybody would suggest that Bill Clinton wasn@-@t a good communicator or was somebody who couldn@-@t connect with the American people or didn@-@t show empathy. </s> <s> @-@In the fall of 1994, things were even better than Obama recalls: unemployment was in fact 5.6 percent. </s> <s> If the feel-your-pain president had trouble when the economy was not nearly as bad as it is now, with 9.6 percent unemployment, then maybe the issue for Obama is not that he is too cool or detached, as some pundits say. </s> <s> When the economy is bad, even the most talented of presidents suffer at the polls. </s> <s> @-@There is an anti-establishment mood,@-@ Rahm Emanuel, the former Clinton aide who served as Obama@-@s first White House chief of staff, told me before he stepped down this month. </s> <s> @-@We just happen to be here when the music is stopping. </s> <s> @-@It would be bad form for the president to anticipate an election result before it happens, but clearly Obama hopes that just as Clinton recovered from his party@-@s midterm shellacking in 1994 to win re-election two years later, so can he. </s> <s> There was something odd in hearing Obama invoke Clinton. </s> <s> Two years ago, Obama scorned the 42nd president, deriding the small-ball politics and triangulation maneuvers and comparing him unfavorably with Ronald Reagan. </s> <s> Running against Clinton@-@s wife, Obama was the anti-Clinton. </s> <s> Now he hopes, in a way, to be the second coming of Bill Clinton. </s> <s> Because, in the end, it@-@s better than being Jimmy Carter. </s> <s> Last month, I made my way through the West Wing talking not only with Obama but also with nearly two dozen of his advisers @-@ some of whom spoke with permission, others without @-@ hoping to understand how the situation looks to them. </s> <s> The view from inside the administration starts with a basic mantra: Obama inherited the worst problems of any president in years. </s> <s> Or in generations. </s> <s> Or in American history. </s> <s> He prevented another Great Depression while putting in place the foundation for a more stable future. </s> <s> But it required him to do unpopular things that would inevitably cost him. </s> <s> @-@He got here, and the expectations for what he could accomplish were very high and probably unrealistic,@-@ Pete Rouse told me. </s> <s> Indeed, David Axelrod and David Plouffe, the masterminds of the 2008 presidential campaign, said they cautioned Obama after his victory to brace himself for a precipitous drop in his popularity given the severity of his challenges. </s> <s> @-@I told him at some point that at the end of @-@10, his approval rating could be low- to mid-30s,@-@ Plouffe told me. </s> <s> Yet even if the White House saw it coming, this is an administration that feels shellshocked. </s> <s> Many officials worry, they say, that the best days of the Obama presidency are behind them. </s> <s> They talk about whether it is time to move on. </s> <s> While not in the 30s, Obama@-@s approval rating in surveys conducted by The New York Times and CBS News had fallen to 45 percent last month from 62 percent when he took office @-@ just a point above where Clinton was before losing Congress in 1994 and three points above where Reagan was before the Republicans lost a couple dozen House seats in 1982. </s> <s> Joel Benenson, Obama@-@s pollster, pointed out that even at 45 percent, the president@-@s popularity eclipses that of Congress, the news media, the banks and other forces in American life. </s> <s> @-@We are in a time when the American public is highly suspect of any institution,@-@ he said, @-@and President Obama still stands above that. </s> <s> @-@ Obama@-@s team takes pride that he has fulfilled three of the five major promises he laid out as pillars of his @-@new foundation@-@ in an April 2009 speech at Georgetown University @-@ health care, education reform and financial reregulation. </s> <s> And they point to decisions to end the combat mission in Iraq while escalating the war in Afghanistan. </s> <s> @-@History will judge Obama that the first two years were very productive,@-@ Rouse says. </s> <s> But it is possible to win the inside game and lose the outside game. </s> <s> In their darkest moments, White House aides wonder aloud whether it is even possible for a modern president to succeed, no matter how many bills he signs. </s> <s> Everything seems to conspire against the idea: an implacable opposition with little if any real interest in collaboration, a news media saturated with triviality and conflict, a culture that demands solutions yesterday, a societal cynicism that holds leadership in low regard. </s> <s> Some White House aides who were ready to carve a new spot on Mount Rushmore for their boss two years ago privately concede now that he cannot be another Abraham Lincoln after all. </s> <s> In this environment, they have increasingly concluded, it may be that every modern president is going to be, at best, average. </s> <s> @-@We@-@re all a lot more cynical now,@-@ one aide told me. </s> <s> The easy answer is to blame the Republicans, and White House aides do that with exuberance. </s> <s> But they are also looking at their own misjudgments, the hubris that led them to think they really could defy the laws of politics. </s> <s> @-@It@-@s not that we believed our own press or press releases, but there was definitely a sense at the beginning that we could really change Washington,@-@ another White House official told me. </s> <s> @-@ @-@Arrogance@-@ isn@-@t the right word, but we were overconfident. </s> <s> @-@The biggest miscalculation in the minds of most Obama advisers was the assumption that he could bridge a polarized capital and forge genuinely bipartisan coalitions. </s> <s> While Republican leaders resolved to stand against Obama, his early efforts to woo the opposition also struck many as halfhearted. </s> <s> @-@If anybody thought the Republicans were just going to roll over, we were just terribly mistaken,@-@ former Senator Tom Daschle, a mentor and an outside adviser to Obama, told me. </s> <s> @-@I@-@m not sure anybody really thought that, but I think we kind of hoped the Republicans would go away. </s> <s> And obviously they didn@-@t do that. </s> <s> @-@Senator Dick Durbin, the No. </s> <s> 2 Democrat in the upper chamber and Obama@-@s ally from Illinois, said the Republicans were to blame for the absence of bipartisanship. </s> <s> @-@I think his fate was sealed,@-@ Durbin said. </s> <s> @-@Once the Republicans decided they would close ranks to defeat him, that just made it extremely difficult and dragged it out for a longer period of time. </s> <s> The American people have a limited attention span. </s> <s> Once you convince them there@-@s a problem, they want a solution.@-@Gov. </s> <s> Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, though, is among the Democrats who grade Obama harshly for not being more nimble in the face of opposition. </s> <s> @-@B-plus, A-minus on substantive accomplishments,@-@ he told me, @-@and a D-plus or C-minus on communication. </s> <s> @-@ The health care legislation is @-@an incredible achievement@-@ and the stimulus program was @-@absolutely, unqualifiedly, enormously successful,@-@ in Rendell@-@s judgment, yet Obama allowed them to be tarnished by critics. </s> <s> @-@They lost the communications battle on both major initiatives, and they lost it early,@-@ said Rendell, an ardent Hillary Clinton backer who later became an Obama supporter. </s> <s> @-@We didn@-@t use the president in either stimulus or health care until we had lost the spin battle. </s> <s> @-@That@-@s a refrain heard inside the White House as well: it@-@s a communication problem. </s> <s> The first refuge of any politician in trouble is that it@-@s a communication problem, not a policy problem. </s> <s> If only I explained what I was doing better, the people would be more supportive. </s> <s> Which roughly translates to If only you people paid attention, you wouldn@-@t be kicking me upside the head. </s> <s> Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, laughed at the ever-ready assumption that all problems stem from poor communication. </s> <s> @-@I haven@-@t been at a policy-problem meeting in 20 months,@-@ he noted. </s> <s> The policy criticism of Obama can be confusing and deeply contradictory @-@ he is a liberal zealot, in the view of the right; a weak accommodationist, in the view of the left. </s> <s> He is an anticapitalist socialist who is too cozy with Wall Street, a weak-on-defense apologist for America who adopted Bush@-@s unrelenting antiterror tactics at the expense of civil liberties. </s> <s> @-@When he talked about being a transformational president, it was about restoring the faith of the American people in our governing institutions,@-@ says Ken Duberstein, the former Reagan White House chief of staff who voted for Obama in 2008. </s> <s> @-@What we now know is that that did not work. </s> <s> If anything, people are even more dubious about all of our institutions, especially government. </s> <s> So to that extent, the transformational side has not worked. </s> <s> And frankly I would settle these days @-@ forget about transformational, how about a transactional president, somebody people could do business with? </s> <s> It seems there@-@s an ideological rigidity that the American people did not sense. </s> <s> @-@The other side would like more ideological rigidity. </s> <s> Norman Solomon, a leading progressive activist and the president of the Institute for Public Accuracy, said Obama has @-@totally blown this great opportunity@-@ to reinvent America by being more aggressive on issues like a public health care option. </s> <s> Other liberals feel the same way about gays in the military or the prison at Gu@-@ntanamo Bay. </s> <s> @-@It@-@s been so reflexive since he was elected, to just give ground and give ground,@-@ Solomon told me. </s> <s> @-@If we don@-@t call him a wimp, which may be the wrong word, he just seems to be backpedaling. </s> <s> @-@ Solomon added: @-@It makes people feel angry and perhaps used. </s> <s> People just feel like, Gee, we really believed in this guy, and his rhetoric is so different than the way he@-@s behaved in office. </s> <s> @-@Pummeled from both sides, Obama clearly seems frustrated and, at times, defensive. </s> <s> At a Labor Day event in Milwaukee, he complained that the special interests treat him badly. </s> <s> @-@They@-@re not always happy with me,@-@ he told supporters. </s> <s> @-@They talk about me like a dog @-@ that@-@s not in my prepared remarks, but it@-@s true. </s> <s> @-@The friendly fire may bother him even more. </s> <s> @-@Democrats just congenitally tend to see the glass as half empty,@-@ Obama said at a fund-raiser in Greenwich, Conn., last month. </s> <s> @-@If we get an historic health care bill passed @-@ oh, well, the public option wasn@-@t there. </s> <s> If you get the financial reform bill passed @-@ then, well, I don@-@t know about this particular derivatives rule, I@-@m not sure that I@-@m satisfied with that. </s> <s> And, gosh, we haven@-@t yet brought about world peace. </s> <s> I thought that was going to happen quicker. </s> <s> @-@Then again, it is Obama himself, and not just his supporters, who casts his presidency in grandiose terms. </s> <s> As he pleaded with Democrats for patience at another fund-raiser in Washington two weeks later: @-@It took time to free the slaves. </s> <s> It took time for women to get the vote. </s> <s> It took time for workers to get the right to organize. </s> <s> @-@One morning around the 100-day mark in Obama@-@s administration, the president and his top aides gathered for their morning meeting in the Oval Office. </s> <s> As they waited for David Axelrod, who was running late, someone noted the coming milestone and asked Obama what surprised him most since taking office. </s> <s> @-@The number of people who don@-@t pay their taxes,@-@ he answered sardonically. </s> <s> From the start, Obama has been surprised by all sorts of challenges that have made it hard for him to govern @-@ not just the big problems that he knew about, like the economy and the wars, but also the myriad little ones that hindered his progress, like one nominee after another brought down by unpaid taxes. </s> <s> Obama trusted his judgment and seemed to have assumed that impressive people in his own party must have a certain basic sense of integrity @-@ and that impressive people in the other party must want to work with him. </s> <s> Four of the five presidents previous to Obama were governors who came to Washington vowing to fix it, only to realize that Washington defies the easy, and often hollow, rhetoric of change. </s> <s> While Obama was a senator when he set off on the campaign trail, he made the same pledges and has encountered the same reality. </s> <s> @-@The story of the first two years is the inherent conflict between a guy who ran from outside to change Washington, gets here and the situation was even worse than we thought it was,@-@ a senior aide told me. </s> <s> @-@Here@-@s a guy who ran as an outsider to change Washington who all of a sudden realized that just to deal with these issues, we were going to have to work with Washington to fix that. </s> <s> @-@Obama does little to disguise his disdain for Washington and the conventions of modern politics. </s> <s> When he emerges from the Oval Office during the day, aides say, he sometimes pauses before the split-screen television in the outer reception area, soaks in the cable chatter, then shakes his head and walks away. </s> <s> @-@He@-@s still never gotten comfortable here,@-@ a top White House official told me. </s> <s> He has little patience for what Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser, calls @-@the inevitable theatrics of Washington. </s> <s> @-@But in politics, theater matters, whether it should or not, a lesson Obama keeps relearning, however grudgingly. </s> <s> His decision to redecorate the Oval Office was criticized as an unnecessary luxury in a time of austerity, no matter that it was paid for by private funds. </s> <s> On the campaign trail, he thought it was silly to wear a flag pin, as if that were a measure of his patriotism, until his refusal to wear a flag pin generated distracting criticism and one day he showed up wearing one. </s> <s> Likewise, he thought it was enough to pray in private while living in the White House, and then a poll showed that most Americans weren@-@t sure he@-@s Christian; sure enough, a few weeks later, he attended services at St. John@-@s Church across from Lafayette Square, photographers in tow. </s> <s> Obama came to office with enormous faith in his own powers of persuasion. </s> <s> He seemed to believe he could overcome divisions if he just sat down with the world@-@s most recalcitrant figures @-@ whether they be the mullahs in Tehran or the Republicans on Capitol Hill. </s> <s> As it turned out, the candidate who said he would be willing to meet in his first year with some of America@-@s enemies @-@without precondition@-@ has met with none of them. </s> <s> And the president who in his State of the Union address this year promised to meet monthly with leaders of both parties in Congress ended up doing so just half as often. </s> <s> He has yet to fully decide whether he is of Washington or apart from it. </s> <s> During the health care debate, Obama had Emanuel cut deals with the pharmaceutical industry, while Axelrod presented the president as above the old business as usual. </s> <s> @-@Perhaps we were na@-@ve,@-@ Axelrod told me. </s> <s> @-@First, he@-@s always had good relations across party lines. </s> <s> And secondly, I think he believed that in the midst of a crisis you could find partners on the other side of the aisle to help deal with it. </s> <s> I don@-@t think anyone here expected the degree of partisanship that we confronted. </s> <s> @-@ Emanuel said Republicans adopted a strategy of poisoning the public well. </s> <s> @-@Part of what they were doing was not just making us grind it out,@-@ he told me. </s> <s> @-@They were souring the country on the mood of the country. </s> <s> @-@Still, Obama plays the partisan game as well. </s> <s> After months of quiet negotiations, some administration officials thought they were close to a package of new financial regulations with Republican support when, to their chagrin, the White House decided to use the issue to wage a high-profile and politically useful battle with Wall Street special interests. </s> <s> At that point, the chances for a deal across party lines collapsed, administration officials said, and Obama was left to rely almost entirely on Democratic votes. </s> <s> Obama advisers who left the White House recently have been struck how different, and worse, things look from the outside. </s> <s> As he made a round of corporate job interviews after stepping down as White House budget director, Peter Orszag was stunned to discover how deep the gulf between the president and business had become. </s> <s> @-@I@-@d thought it was an 8, but it@-@s more like a 10,@-@ he told me. </s> <s> @-@And rather than wasting time debating whether it@-@s legitimate,@-@ he added, referring to his former colleagues, @-@the key is to recognize that it@-@s affecting what they do. </s> <s> @-@Insulation is a curse of every president, but more than any president since Jimmy Carter, Obama comes across as an introvert, someone who finds extended contact with groups of people outside his immediate circle to be draining. </s> <s> He can rouse a stadium of 80,000 people, but that audience is an impersonal monolith; smaller group settings can be harder for him. </s> <s> Aides have learned that it can be good if he has a few moments after a big East Room event so he can gather his energy again. </s> <s> Unlike Clinton, who never met a rope line he did not want to work, Obama does not relish glad-handing. </s> <s> That@-@s what he has Vice President Joe Biden for. </s> <s> When Obama addressed the Business Roundtable this year, he left after his speech without much meet-and-greet, leaving his aides frustrated that he had done himself more harm than good. </s> <s> He is not much for chitchat. </s> <s> When he and I sat down, he started our session matter-of-factly: @-@All right,@-@ he said, @-@fire away. </s> <s> @-@By all accounts, Obama copes with his political troubles with equanimity. </s> <s> @-@Zen@-@ is the word commonly used in the West Wing. </s> <s> That@-@s not to say he never loses his temper. </s> <s> He has been known to snap at aides when he feels overscheduled. </s> <s> He cuts off advisers who spout information straight from briefing papers with a testy @-@I@-@ve already read that. </s> <s> @-@ He does not like it when aides veer out of their assigned lanes, yet they have learned to show up at meetings with an opinion, because he zeroes in on those who stay silent. </s> <s> He was subdued during the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, when he found himself largely powerless. </s> <s> Other presidents took refuge at Camp David, but Michelle Obama has told dinner guests that her husband does not care for it all that much, because he is an urban guy. </s> <s> He blows off steam on the White House basketball court. </s> <s> @-@Come on, man, you@-@ve got to make that shot,@-@ he chides aides who play with him. </s> <s> The most obvious sign of strain is in his hair. </s> <s> @-@He@-@ll probably be unhappy with me for saying, but I@-@ve noticed he@-@s gotten a little grayer,@-@ Defense Secretary Robert Gates told me over the summer. </s> <s> @-@These kinds of decisions do that to people. </s> <s> @-@ But the stress of the job remains mostly unspoken. </s> <s> @-@We usually will talk about writing the condolence letters,@-@ Gates added. </s> <s> @-@But other than that, we don@-@t dwell on it. </s> <s> @-@ If anything, Obama more often than not bucks up young members of his staff, reminding them that politics, like life, is full of cycles and they will someday be able to tell their children that they were part of something big. </s> <s> While Clinton made late-night phone calls around Washington to vent or seek advice, Obama rarely reaches outside the tight group of advisers like Emanuel, Axelrod, Rouse, Messina, Plouffe, Gibbs and Jarrett, as well as a handful of personal friends. </s> <s> @-@He@-@s opaque even to us,@-@ an aide told me. </s> <s> @-@Except maybe for a few people in the inner circle, he@-@s a closed book. </s> <s> @-@ In part because of security, just 15 people have his BlackBerry e-mail address. </s> <s> On long Air Force One flights, he retreats to the conference room and plays spades for hours, maintaining a trash-talking contest all the while, with the same three aides: Reggie Love, his personal assistant; Marvin Nicholson, his trip director; and Pete Souza, his White House photographer. </s> <s> @-@When I asked if he had an iPad, Obama said, @-@I have an iReggie, who has my books, my newspapers, my music all in one place. </s> <s> @-@Jarrett attributes Obama@-@s equilibrium to his upbringing. </s> <s> @-@He@-@s really different,@-@ she told me. </s> <s> @-@It@-@s rooted in his sense of self and how he grew up with a single mom, living at times on food stamps, working as a community organizer. </s> <s> @-@ As Gibbs put it: @-@He has a remarkable way of focusing on the big picture and the longer term. </s> <s> It@-@s not to say that he@-@s immune from criticism. </s> <s> But he can categorize in his head the difference between what@-@s a setback, what@-@s a bump along the way and what@-@s just noise. </s> <s> @-@There is certainly no shortage of noise. </s> <s> But as Obama gets back on the campaign trail, aides have noticed his old spirit again. </s> <s> He particularly enjoys the so-called backyard sessions on the lawns of supporters. </s> <s> @-@That@-@s the happiest I@-@ve seen him in a long time,@-@ an aide said. </s> <s> After one, Obama told the aide, @-@This reminds me of Iowa on the bus. </s> <s> @-@Nostalgia for the good old days of the campaign afflicts any White House in trouble. </s> <s> After all, those were the romantic moments when all was possible, when tens of thousands of people would gather in Grant Park to tear up over the promise of what will be. </s> <s> But in sober moments, Obama understands how selective the memories really are. </s> <s> @-@The mythology has emerged somehow that we ran this flawless campaign, I never made a mistake, that we were master communicators, everything worked in lock step,@-@ he told me. </s> <s> @-@And somehow now, as president, things are messy and they don@-@t always work as planned and people are mad at us. </s> <s> That@-@s not how I look at stuff, because I remember what the campaign was like. </s> <s> And it was just as messy and just as difficult. </s> <s> And there were all sorts of moments when our supporters lost hope, and it looked like we weren@-@t going to win. </s> <s> And we@-@re going through that same period here. </s> <s> @-@In covering the last three presidents, I have watched as each has been tested, albeit in very different circumstances @-@ Clinton@-@s impeachment over false testimony under oath about an affair with a White House intern, Bush@-@s drive to begin a war that would drag on for years at enormous cost and Obama@-@s struggle to turn around the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. </s> <s> They are starkly variable crises, but some dynamics are familiar: presidents who live and die by polls insist they are not important when they fall; they argue that they are focused on principle, not politics, when it@-@s almost always a mixture of both; they acknowledge difficulties but say they will pass; they portray themselves as courageous when flying against public opinion; they complain that the news media distort the situation and fuel division; they blame their opponents for practicing the politics of destruction and obstruction. </s> <s> Talking with Obama and his aides, it@-@s eerie to hear echoes of Clinton and Bush. </s> <s> Obama says the easy issues never make it to him, only the hard ones; Bush often said the same thing. </s> <s> Obama says our war with terrorists will never end in a surrender ceremony; Bush often said the same thing. </s> <s> Obama says he does not want to kick problems down the road; Bush often said the same thing. </s> <s> In the days leading up to the 1994 midterm elections, Clinton mocked Republicans for promising to balance the budget while cutting taxes, saying, @-@They@-@re not serious. </s> <s> @-@ In our conversation, Obama used some variation of the phrase @-@they@-@re not serious@-@ four times in referring to Republican budget plans. </s> <s> That is not to say the three men are alike; indeed, they are vastly different. </s> <s> But putting ideology aside, Obama at times seems to be a cross between his two predecessors. </s> <s> Like Clinton, he digs into the intellectual underpinnings of a policy decision, studying briefing books and seeking a range of opinions. </s> <s> Some aides express frustration that he can leave decisions unresolved for too long. </s> <s> But like Bush, once he has made a decision, Obama rarely revisits it. </s> <s> And like Bush, he runs a pretty disciplined operation; he started our interview a half-hour ahead of schedule, just as Bush sometimes did. </s> <s> Clinton, on the other hand, still runs on Clinton Standard Time. </s> <s> Just a few weeks ago, he was more than six hours late for a scheduled interview with another journalist. </s> <s> One constant among all three: It took Clinton and Bush some time to really grow into the presidency, until they wore it comfortably. </s> <s> As Obama looks to the experiences of Clinton and Reagan, who both rebounded from midterm debacles to win re-election, the lessons differ. </s> <s> In Reagan@-@s case, the House was already in Democratic hands, so during his first two years, he forged coalitions of Republicans and conservative Democrats. </s> <s> After the opposition was strengthened in the 1982 elections, that was no longer viable, and Reagan began working more with Democratic leaders. </s> <s> Clinton likewise changed course after the 1994 elections, emphasizing more incremental, piece-by-piece change rather than sweeping proposals and pursuing goals like welfare reform and balanced budgets when he could agree with Newt Gingrich@-@s new majority. </s> <s> Clinton, though, was more instinctively centrist than Obama is, and his revival owed much to other factors, particularly his leadership after the Oklahoma City bombing and his budget standoff with Gingrich during the partial government shutdown. </s> <s> Some argue Obama might be better off with at least one Republican chamber so he too has a foil as Clinton did. </s> <s> But it is unclear if Obama is as agile a politician as Reagan or Clinton. </s> <s> @-@He@-@s no Bill Clinton when it comes to having the ability to move and to wiggle,@-@ says Joe Gaylord, a top Gingrich adviser. </s> <s> @-@I find rigidity in Obama that comes from his life in liberalism. </s> <s> @-@ Ken Duberstein likewise doubts Obama@-@s capacity for adjustment. </s> <s> @-@They@-@re much better at the art of campaigning than the art of governing,@-@ he said. </s> <s> Perhaps the more important historical pattern to consider is this one: The last four presidents who failed to win a second term were all challenged in their own party. </s> <s> Lyndon Johnson was driven out of the race in 1968 after nearly losing the New Hampshire primary to Eugene McCarthy. </s> <s> Gerald Ford fended off Reagan in 1976 but went on to lose the general election to Carter, who likewise had to beat a primary challenger four years later, Ted Kennedy, before falling to Reagan. </s> <s> And George H. W.

of those things easier said in the first or second year of a presidency. </s> <s> By the third, it starts to become an actual choice. </s> <s> Forks in the road require a president to decide if he will advance ideas that will genuinely change the country even if deeply unpopular or if he will opt instead for a safer route that does not put re-election at risk. </s> <s> Obama aides like to argue that he has already demonstrated willingness to put aside politics by bailing out the banks and automakers, decisions that he saw as critical to preventing greater economic catastrophe @-@and that ultimately cost taxpayers far less than initially feared@-@. </s> <s> But would he jeopardize re-election absent an immediate crisis? </s> <s> The choice may confront him soon after the midterms when his bipartisan fiscal commission reports back by Dec. 1 with plans to tame the national deficit with a politically volatile menu of unpalatable options, like scaling back Medicare and Social Security while raising taxes. </s> <s> Obama also anticipates putting immigration reform, another divisive issue fraught with political danger, back on the table. </s> <s> @-@If the question is, Over the next two years do I take a pass on tough stuff,@-@ he told me, @-@the answer is no. </s> <s> @-@Obama@-@s aides say they will most likely set up their re-election campaign around next March, roughly the same as when Bush and Clinton incorporated their incumbent campaign operations. </s> <s> They are more optimistic about 2012 than they are about 2010, believing the Tea Party will re-elect Barack Obama by pulling the Republican nominee to the right. </s> <s> They doubt Sarah Palin will run and figure Mitt Romney cannot get the Republican nomination because he enacted his own health care program in Massachusetts. </s> <s> If they had to guess today, some in the White House say that Obama will find himself running against Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor. </s> <s> With that campaign on the horizon, Obama asked Pete Rouse and Jim Messina to begin thinking about the next phase of his presidency, not just personnel but also priorities and message. </s> <s> Never mind that

year@-@s end, there will be a new chief of staff, a new national-economics adviser, a new budget director, a new chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and a new national-security adviser, among others. </s> <s> Axelrod and Messina expect to leave by spring to set up Obama@-@s re-election effort, and Plouffe will almost certainly come into the White House in a senior role. </s> <s> @-@There

the aide said. </s> <s> @-@He doesn@-@t like confrontation. </s> <s> @-@ But his initial choices to fill open slots have been drawn largely from his administration, suggesting more continuity than change. </s> <s> Rouse and Messina see areas for possible bipartisan agreement, like reauthorizing the nation@-@s education laws to include reform measures favored by centrists and conservatives, passing long-pending trade pacts and possibly even producing scaled-back energy legislation. </s> <s> @-@You@-@ll hear more about exports and less about public spending,@-@ a senior White House

Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers, the director of the White House National Economic Council, @-@offered sophisticated explanations for every decision at a level of complexity that easily bamboozled reporters. </s> <s> @-@ Obama himself had two sides @-@ Chicago community organizer and Ivy League meritocrat. </s> <s> The meritocrat won out. </s> <s> According to Alter, @-@Obama@-@s faith lay in cream rising to the top. </s> <s> Because he himself was a product of the great American postwar meritocracy, he could never fully escape seeing the world from the status ladder he had ascended. </s> <s> @-@ In this regard, the contrast with Franklin Roosevelt, who heartily reciprocated the enmity of the privileged class from which he had emerged, is striking. </s> <s> This faith in Ivy League rationality may also help to explain Obama@-@s initial abundant confidence about ushering in a new era of better, if not good, feelings. </s> <s> But from the outset, the House Republicans made it clear that they would battle Obama at every turn @-@ even before he officially became president. </s> <s> Unlike Roosevelt, who refused to coordinate any policies with Herbert Hoover before he was sworn into office, Obama struck out on a bipartisan course in September 2008, when the financial meltdown took place. </s> <s> At a pivotal meeting at the White House, Obama took command, while George W. Bush and John McCain listened passively. </s> <s> @-@Afterward, Alter reports, Obama told aides the meeting was @-@surreal. </s> <s> @-@ Alter rather expansively defines this moment as the true inauguration of the Obama presidency. </s> <s> Instead, one might say it marked both the expiry of the Bush presidency, which sought to manipulate the bureaucracy for conservative aims, and the flowering of the radical right, which views government itself as the enemy. </s> <s> Perhaps the most significant political impact of that September session was the antipathy House Republicans displayed toward a financial bailout plan being proposed by Bush@-@s own Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson, and that Obama, too, was essentially endorsing. </s> <s> Right then and there, Obama would have done well to ponder his ability to soften the Republican Party@-@s opposition to overhauling either the economy or health care. </s> <s> However, a confident Obama, Alter writes, overrode his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, to insist on an all-out effort on behalf of health care. </s> <s> Alter might have emphasized that it was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, more than anyone else, who rescued Obama, and possibly his presidency. </s> <s> With the passage of health care, Obama has been revivified. </s> <s> Alter himself, with an almost audible sigh of relief, signs out with the observation that Obama is now @-@in the company of Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson, . </s> <s> .

elections, Republicans dropped from 117 to 103 seats in the House and 35 to 25 in the Senate. </s> <s> Despite the predictions of huge Democratic losses this fall, a sweeping Republican victory may not materialize, especially if Obama remains personally popular. </s> <s> Whatever the case, it seems unlikely that the cautious Obama, a true conservative at a moment when the term has become soiled by its current representatives, will preside over a new era of resurgent liberalism. </s> <s> Still, if he outflanks his opponents, winds down two wars and, above all, revives the economy, he will surely more than fulfill his abundant promise, and the dream of change that his campaign so skillfully evoked. </s> <s> Economic SceneBy David LeonhardtWASHINGTONWith the Senate@-@s passage of

Johnson@-@s Great Society, the new progressive period has the makings of a generational shift in how Washington operates. </s> <s> First came a stimulus bill that, while aimed mainly at ending a deep recession, also set out to remake the nation@-@s educational system and vastly expand scientific research. </s> <s> Then President Obama signed a health care bill that was the biggest expansion of the safety net in 40 years. </s> <s> And now Congress is in the final stages of a bill that would tighten Wall Street@-@s rules and probably shrink its profit margins. </s> <s> If there is a theme to all this, it has been to try to lift economic growth while also reducing income inequality. </s> <s> Growth in the decade that just ended was the slowest in the post-World War II era, while inequality has been rising for most of the last 35 years. </s> <s> It is far too early to know if these efforts will work. </s> <s> Their success depends enormously on execution and, in the case of financial regulation, specifically on the Federal Reserve, which did not distinguish itself during the housing bubble. </s> <s> Already, though, one downside to the legislative spurt does seem clear. </s> <s> By focusing on long-term problems, Mr. Obama and the Democrats have given less than their full attention to the economy@-@s current weakness and turned off a good number of voters. </s> <s> After months of discussion, and with the unemployment rate hovering near a 27-year high, Democratic leaders said Thursday they had finally reached agreement on a bill that would send aid to states and take

attitudes before November@-@s midterm elections. </s> <s> Still, the turnabout since Jan. 20 @-@ the first anniversary of Mr. Obama@-@s inauguration and the day after Scott Brown, a Republican, won a

Reagan. </s> <s> @-@If you@-@d asked me about this administration after Scott Brown was elected, I@-@d have told you it was going to fizzle into virtually nothing,@-@ said Theda Skocpol, the Harvard political scientist. </s> <s> @-@Now it could easily be one of the pivotal periods in domestic policy. </s> <s> @-@ But, Ms. Skocpol added, @-@It will depend on what happens in the next two elections. </s> <s> @-@The recent period surely will not match the impact of the New Deal. </s> <s> Nothing is likely to, notes David Kennedy,a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, because the New Deal created much

of the Depression, added: @-@This is not the New Deal, but it@-@s a significant series of achievements. </s> <s> And given the difficulty of getting anything done under the gridlock of Congress, it@-@s pretty surprising. </s> <s> @-@The last 16 months seem most similar in scope to three other periods in the last 80 years. </s> <s> After World War II, the federal government helped build the modern middle class with the G. I. </s> <s> Bill, housing subsidies, the highway system and incentives for employers to offer health insurance. </s> <s> The 1960s @-@ mostly under Mr. Johnson, but also Richard Nixon @-@ brought civil rights legislation, Medicare, Medicaid and environmental laws. </s> <s> Then Mr. Reagan ushered in a period that continued, more or less, until 2008: tax cuts, less regulation and other attempts to unleash the competitive forces of the market. </s> <s> Mr. Obama has been trying to reverse the Reagan thrust in some important ways. </s> <s> Although the Reagan administration did not shrink the size of the federal government, it changed the ways that Washington collected and spent its money, by reducing taxes on the affluent, cutting some social programs and increasing military spending. </s> <s> These policies ended up magnifying income inequality, which was already rising for other reasons. </s> <s> Since 1980, median household income has risen only 30 percent, adjusted for inflation, while average incomes at the top have tripled or quadrupled. </s> <s> Every major piece of the Obama agenda is meant, in part, to push back against inequality. </s> <s> Government may grow, but the bigger change will be how the government is spending its money. </s> <s> The health bill expanded insurance coverage largely for middle-class and poor families and paid some of the bill by taxing households making more than @-@250,000 a year. </s> <s> Attached to the final health bill were also education provisions that cut subsidies to banks making student loans, and used much of the money for college financial aid instead. </s> <s> The financial regulation bill, meanwhile, would take several steps likely to reduce Wall Street@-@s profits @-@ and Wall Street has created more multimillionaires in recent decades than any other industry. </s> <s> To take one example, certain trades would be forced onto open exchanges. </s> <s> This would hurt financial firms@-@ ability to act as a middleman, much as Expedia and other travel Web sites have hurt travel agents. </s> <s> For all these differences, though, there are also ways that Mr. Obama and today@-@s Democrats have accepted, and are even furthering, the Reagan project. </s> <s> They are not trying to raise tax rates on the affluent to anywhere near their pre-1981 levels. </s> <s> Their health bill created new private insurance markets, rather than expanding Medicare. </s> <s> Most striking, the administration is trying to improve public education by introducing more market competition. </s> <s> To win stimulus funds, about 20 states have changed their rules to allow more charter schools or to evaluate teachers in new ways. </s> <s> On Thursday, Gov. </s> <s> Bill Ritter Jr. of Colorado signed a bill that would reward teachers who received strong evaluations and deny tenure to some who did poorly. </s> <s> These education changes @-@ combined with increased spending on science research @-@ are meant to lift economic growth. </s> <s> Economists have long considered education and technology to be the main ingredients in growth. </s> <s> In Mr. Obama@-@s phrasing, the goal is to create a @-@new foundation,@-@ more solid than the bubbles of recent years. </s> <s> Even with those bubbles, the nation@-@s economic output expanded only 20 percent from 2000 through 2009. </s> <s> In the 1980s, it grew 35 percent, and in the 1990s, it grew 37 percent. </s> <s> Will this new progressive project succeed? </s> <s> There are any number of uncertainties: whether enough charter schools will succeed, whether the new health insurance markets will function well, whether the Fed will learn to become an effective regulator of Wall Street. </s> <s> Some of those questions won@-@t be resolved for years. </s> <s> But one issue should become clear much sooner. </s> <s> Mr. Reagan, Mr. Johnson and Franklin D.

officials and gay rights advocates said, reflects two conflicting forces. </s> <s> He recognizes that support for gay rights and same-sex marriage is growing, particularly among young voters. </s> <s> But he is reluctant in an election year to be drawn into a culture-war issue @-@ one that reliably helps Republicans turn out evangelical voters in their favor and also strikes a particular nerve with religious black voters, a bedrock Obama constituency in battleground states like North Carolina and Florida. </s> <s> There is little indication that Mr. Obama plans to endorse same-sex marriage before the presidential election in November, despite recent statements that tiptoe right up to that position. </s> <s> Speaking to a gay rights group in October, he said, @-@Every single American @-@

into an unmitigated good stream of energy. </s> <s> @-@Interviews with administration officials, however, suggest that the president believes he can stand pat and still win a large majority of gay votes, based on his track record, which includes his decision not to defend a 1996 law that defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman. </s> <s> The president may have history on his side: a nationwide exit poll conducted by the firm Edison@-@Mitofsky in the 2008 elections found that 4 percent of voters indicated they were gay. </s> <s> Of that group, 70 percent said they voted

Mr. Gingrich as the Republican nominee, but the pro-Gingrich messages in each raise a host of election law questions, highlighting the way that politically motivated groups can influence the outcome of elections by sidestepping federal policy. </s> <s> Liberty, a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization, is prohibited by law from intervening in a federal election. </s> <s> Mr. Gingrich has essentially bet his candidacy that the conventional wisdom of professional consultants @-@ namely, that at some point every campaign must go negative because it works @-@ is wrongheaded. </s> <s> He repeatedly tells crowds that the sole beneficiary of Republicans@-@ attacking one another will be President Obama. </s> <s> One of the reasons more than a dozen Gingrich staff members quit in the spring was that

@-@It@-@s made us more focused because we@-@ll have a real fight on our hands. </s> <s> @-@The anti-Gingrich attack in Iowa is inescapable: 45 percent of political ads on television during December have been attacks on Mr. Gingrich, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. </s> <s> Many are the work of Restore Our Future, the super PAC supporting Mr. Romney, whose latest ad, @-@Whoops,@-@ shows Mr. Gingrich admitting he erred in past positions he took on health care and global warming. </s> <s> Earlier attacks by the group hammered him for a consulting deal with Freddie Mac and accused

people were telling him they wanted the candidate to fight fire with fire. </s> <s> @-@They wish for it,@-@ he added. </s> <s> The closest Mr. Gingrich has come to responding in kind on the airwaves has been an ad in which he referred to opponents in the mildest of terms, without naming anyone. </s> <s> @-@Others seem to be more focused on attacks rather than moving the country forward,@-@ he said. </s> <s> A super PAC that supports Mr. Gingrich, Winning Our Future, has an ad that takes a shot at Mr. Romney as the choice of the @-@liberal Republican establishment,@-@ but it does not name him and mostly praises Mr. Gingrich as @-@a principled conservative. </s> <s> @-@The group, run by former Gingrich aides, seems constrained by his vow to tell supporters not to contribute to any group that runs attack ads on his behalf. </s> <s> Mr. Gingrich draws a distinction between criticizing rivals in ads, a practice he says he will not tolerate, and lancing them in interviews with the news media @-@ a distinction not always as apparent to observers as it is in his mind. </s> <s> In a television interview this week, he said he would not vote for Representative Ron Paul of Texas if he were the nominee and labeled his foreign policy @-@outside the mainstream of virtually every decent American. </s> <s> @-@ He accused Mr. Romney at a news conference last week of being @-@purely dishonest@-@ in claiming he could not influence the super PAC behind the attack ads. </s> <s> The senior staff members who discussed tougher, in-kind responses to the attack ads did so as an exercise in considering options, but ultimately did not press Mr. Gingrich because they knew his preference for focusing on @-@positive solutions@-@ in his ads. </s> <s> @-@Whether it works, we@-@re going to watch,@-@ a senior adviser said. </s> <s> Some supporters think that in sticking to a high road, Mr. Gingrich is afraid of unleashing the memory of the sharp-tongued, divisive Newt Gingrich of the

Strawn, chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa. </s> <s> With recent polls showing that more than half of likely caucus voters have not made up their minds, Mr. Strawn said people throwing their support behind a candidate on Facebook or Twitter could affect the outcome. </s> <s> @-@That is what could sway an undecided voter,@-@ he said. </s> <s> For Mr. Romney, the question is whether his targeted online advertising and social media strategy in Iowa will help make up for his belated decision to compete aggressively there. </s> <s> And, will it be enough to stave off the recent surge in support for Representative Ron Paul of Texas, who has managed to produce both highly enthusiastic supporters online and large crowds at rallies across Iowa? </s> <s> @-@Ron Paul@-@s supporters are intense, and they show up,@-@ said Timothy Hagle, a professor of political science at the University of Iowa. </s> <s> A big test for Mr. Paul, however, will be translating his online support into votes since so many of his supporters are college students now home on winter break. </s> <s> In New Hampshire, Mr. Gingrich is relying heavily on social media and online tools to bolster a campaign organization that did not have much of a structure in place until late October. </s> <s> His state director, Andrew Hemingway, is a Tea Party activist from Bristol, N. H., who is well acquainted with leveraging the power of social media platforms, having helped organize the first Tea Party presidential debate on Twitter earlier this year. </s> <s> One of his first moves was creating the Web site NewtHampshire.com and New Hampshire-specific Twitter and Facebook accounts, where he and other campaign leaders engage regularly with supporters. </s> <s> @-@Just like you would have county captains or city captains, we have people doing the same thing but only on Facebook and Twitter,@-@ Mr. Hemingway said. </s> <s> @-@They are out there recruiting people, giving them messaging, and then they broadcast those messages to their networks on Twitter and Facebook. </s> <s> @-@He said the campaign had already started to urge supporters to identify family and friends to join them at the polls. </s> <s> And, like most of the other candidates, Mr. Gingrich is recruiting volunteers online to make calls on his behalf to prospective voters in New Hampshire and Iowa. </s> <s> People can also see which of their Facebook friends have already made calls for Mr. Gingrich. </s> <s> @-@Through Facebook, you pull down a link and you can call from home,@-@ said Mr. Hemingway, whose phone bank room at Gingrich headquarters in New Hampshire is equipped with netbooks and headphones for supporters who want to go to traditional phone rooms. </s> <s> @-@We are doing more calls per hour than any campaign in the state. </s> <s> @-@ Republicans are looking to duplicate what President Obama managed to do four years ago, galvanizing supporters online to raise hundreds of millions of dollars and integrate his digital efforts into the field operation to mobilize voters. </s> <s> During last year@-@s midterm elections, Republican candidates and voters caught up with Democrats in deploying social media. </s> <s> In studies released this year, the Pew Research Center@-@s Internet and American Life Project found that 40 percent of Republican online users turned to social media to get information and to become politically involved in a campaign during the midterm elections last year. </s> <s> @-@These are tools that can be used to drive real-world action and encourage people to take action beyond posting news and talking to their friends,@-@ said Aaron Smith, a senior researcher at the Pew Center. </s> <s> @-@Our view is that social media allows a campaign to identify those rock-star supporters and get them to take action on their behalf. </s> <s> @-@ Digital strategists for the candidates said they were mindful that online efforts alone would not be enough to mobilize the foot soldiers they need to get out the vote and win. </s> <s> Mr. Gingrich@-@s hundreds of thousands of Facebook fans and Twitter followers were not enough to get him the 10,000 signatures he needed to get on the ballot in Virginia. </s> <s> Also, half of Iowans are not on Facebook, so candidates have been bombarding them with mailers, traditional television advertising and automated phone calls from candidates. </s> <s> Striking that balance between old and new is vital for Mrs. Bachmann, Rick Santorum, Gov. </s> <s> Rick Perry of Texas and Mr. Gingrich, who are all vying for the support of the state@-@s evangelical Christians. </s> <s> While Christian conservatives @-@ and Tea Party activists @-@ now have a robust online and social media presence, it was this collection of Bible study groups, anti-abortion activists, homeschooling parents and other evangelical Christian groups that helped the Republican Mike Huckabee win the Iowa caucuses in 2008. </s> <s> @-@It is about finding people who can amplify your voice to them,@-@ said R. Rebecca Donatelli, digital strategist for Mrs. Bachmann. </s> <s> @-@It is the old concept of coalitions made new again. </s> <s> @-@ Vincent Harris, digital adviser to Mr. Perry, said he used

Nixon discredit Hubert H. Humphrey in 1968, or the reliance on selective recitations of Congressional votes that have twisted the positions of candidates running from a perch in Washington. </s> <s> It averts the need to shoot

outlets like C-Span digitizing their video archives and making them available online, old footage is easy to come by. </s> <s> Anyone with an Internet connection and the patience to conduct a lengthy Google search can be an opposition researcher. </s> <s> And the willingness of some campaigns not only to employ old film but to rip it out of context seems to be greater than ever. </s> <s> According to the Kantar Media Campaign Media Analysis Group, Iowans have been subjected to commercials about candidates 17,151 times this year. </s> <s> Of those, 10,591 were negative. </s> <s> In dollar terms,

down opponents. </s> <s> Over the past week, Mr. Gingrich has borne the brunt of the attacks, and his support among likely Republican voters showed signs of eroding as a result. </s> <s> Mitt Romney employs a small team of video- and film-savvy staff members who produce ads from three editing suites at the campaign@-@s headquarters in Boston@-@s North End. </s> <s> Their recent productions include one 30-second Web video that shows Mr. Gingrich telling the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2010 that @-@Governor Romney, in his business career, created more jobs than the entire

Senator John McCain. </s> <s> @-@If we keep talking about the economy,@-@ Mr. Obama says, @-@we@-@re going to lose. </s> <s> @-@ The ad makes it appear as if the president, who was speaking in 2008 about his rival@-@s campaign, was referring to his own political fate in the 2012 election. </s> <s> Rick Perry@-@s campaign went after Mr. Obama with a similarly deceptive ad that takes an out-of-context approach to the president@-@s remarks that American businesses have been lazy about attracting foreign investment. </s> <s> But as Mr. Romney has learned, the in-your-own-words game is a double-edged sword. </s> <s> He has been subject to relentless skewering by the video staff at the Democratic National Committee, which, like Mr. Romney@-@s team, trawls the Internet for footage. </s> <s> The committee@-@s most attention-grabbing ad was one called @-@Trapped@-@ that showed Mr. Romney making contradictory statements on issues like abortion. </s> <s> Mr. Romney also saw himself skewered in a commercial produced by a little-known political group called American LP. </s> <s> It contains footage of him welcoming volunteers to the Salt Lake City Olympics in French. </s> <s> Along the bottom are what are purported to be subtitles but are actually quotes from previous statements that Mr. Romney has made, like his comment that he is politically independent. </s> <s> One benefit from producing such provocative ads is that the groups and campaigns broadcasting them are able to generate publicity while spending little or no money buying time on television. </s> <s> The Romney @-@Believe@-@ ad was broadcast on a single station in New Hampshire just a handful of times. </s> <s> And the Democratic National Committee spent only about @-@20,000 to broadcast @-@Trapped. </s> <s> @-@ The ad with Mr. Romney speaking French was barely shown at all. </s> <s> @-@But they all got plenty of play on cable news and in blogs. </s> <s> @-@In that sense, the use of old footage in campaign ads mirrors the larger shift in the way voters are getting their campaign news. </s> <s> Some strategists see it as an extension of the way the primary process is evolving as it moves beyond Iowa pizza restaurants and church basements and is played out almost exclusively on national television. </s> <s> @-@Voters are looking more discretely at the messages being presented by campaigns, and I think that@-@s one of the reasons the debates are more impactful this time,@-@ said Tad Devine, a Democratic media strategist. </s> <s> As voters grow more wary of messages relayed

</s> <s> The poll found that 41 percent of voters who said that they planned to attend the caucuses could still change their minds. </s> <s> The poll found Mr. Romney with 24 percent; Mr. Paul at 22 percent; Mr. Santorum with 15 percent; the former House speaker, Newt Gingrich, at 12 percent; Mr. Perry at 11 percent; and Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota at 7 percent. </s> <s> The poll, which was conducted Tuesday through Friday, has a margin of error of 4 percentage points. </s> <s> The Register@-@s Iowa Poll, which is the most closely watched political survey in the state, found that Mr. Santorum appears to have gained significant ground in recent days. </s> <s> If he is able to consolidate support from social conservatives and win over undecided voters, the outcome of

Huntsman Jr., Ron Paul, Rick Perry and Mitt Romney have provided detailed answers about their views on executive power in response to questions on the topic posed by The New York Times, which is publishing the full text of their responses online. </s> <s> The answers show that most of them see the commander in chief as having the authority to lawfully take extraordinary actions if he decides doing so is necessary to protect national security. </s> <s> Only Mr. Paul, the libertarian-leaning congressman from Texas, argued for a more limited view of presidential power. </s> <s> The views of the other four candidates who responded echoed in many respects expansive legal theories that were advanced by President George W. Bush. </s> <s> In certain significant ways, they dovetailed as well with the assertive posture taken by President Obama since taking office, like his expanded use of drones to kill terrorism suspects around the world @-@ including a United States citizen. </s> <s> The answers come against the backdrop of a decade of disputes over the scope and limits of presidential authority. </s> <s> Because executive branch actions are often secret and courts rarely have jurisdiction to review them, the views of the president @-@ and the lawyers he appoints @-@ about the powers the Constitution gives him are far more than an academic discussion. </s> <s> Instead, in practice, a president@-@s views can influence such momentous matters as whether and how the country commits acts of warfare abroad, the rights of American citizens at home and the ability of government officials to keep information secret from lawmakers, the courts and the public. </s> <s> Asked to describe the circumstances under which the Constitution permits a president to order the targeted killing of a citizen who has not been sentenced to death by a court, Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Huntsman, Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney all said that a president could order the killing of a citizen who joins an enemy force that is at war with the United States, at least under certain conditions. </s> <s> @-@My preference would be to capture, interrogate, and prosecute any U. S. citizen who has engaged in acts of war against the United States,@-@ Mr. Romney wrote. </s> <s> @-@But if necessary to defend the country, I would be willing to authorize the use of lethal force. </s> <s> @-@The Obama administration embraced similar reasoning as the basis for a drone strike in Yemen this year that killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen whom executive branch officials accused of being a terrorist operative. </s> <s> Mr. Paul, by contrast, described the circumstances in which a president could order the extrajudicial killing of a citizen in one word: @-@None. </s> <s> @-@ Similarly, while Mr. Paul said that a president should not order a military attack without Congressional permission unless there was an imminent threat, the other four candidates agreed that a president could do so if he decided it was necessary. </s> <s> An exception to that pattern was the use of signing statements to claim a right to bypass new statutes @-@ often, provisions in bills that limit executive power @-@ a president signs into law. </s> <s> The three current and former governors among the candidates @-@ Mr. Perry, Mr. Huntsman and Mr. Romney @-@ each described circumstances in which he would use the device to raise constitutional concerns about legislation, with Mr. Romney outlining the most assertive version. </s> <s> The two former House colleagues, Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Paul, said they would not issue such statements. </s> <s> @-@Mr. Gingrich has taken a more assertive view about constitutional disagreements with the judicial branch, saying presidents may lawfully ignore Supreme Court rulings. </s> <s> @-@Two other Republican candidates, Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum, did not answer the questions. </s> <s> Mr. Obama did not either; his re-election campaign said he had @-@pursued policies that strengthen our security@-@ while @-@upholding our laws and values@-@ and suggested that he would debate such matters in greater detail after Republicans chose his opponent. </s> <s> Mr. Obama @-@ along with Mr. Romney and Mr. Paul @-@ participated in a similar project by The Boston Globe during the 2008 presidential primary campaign. </s> <s> His record in office shows how circumstances and the assumption of power can alter views expressed in a campaign. </s> <s> Asked if a president could bomb Iran without Congressional permission, Mr. Obama, then a senator, said, @-@The president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation. </s> <s> @-@In 2011, after the United Nations approved an air campaign in Libya to protect civilians, Mr. Obama @-@ without Congressional permission @-@ deployed the American military to join NATO allies in airborne attacks on Libyan government forces. </s> <s> In asserting the legality of that step, the Justice Department issued a memorandum saying that Mr. Obama had inherent constitutional power to do so because he could @-@reasonably determine that such use of force was in the national interest. </s> <s> @-@ Later, Mr. Obama also adopted the view @-@ overruling Justice Department and Pentagon lawyers @-@ that he could lawfully continue the bombing and drone strikes beyond a 60-day clock imposed by the War Powers Resolution because they did not constitute the sort of @-@hostilities@-@ regulated by that law. </s> <s> In the survey answers, Mr. Perry criticized that approach, arguing that Mr. Obama should have instead asserted that the War Powers Resolution was an unconstitutional constraint on his wartime powers rather than employing @-@a convoluted, unbelievable definition of @-@hostilities. </s> <s> @-@Presidential power has been growing since the early years of the cold war and ratcheted forward under the Bush administration, which asserted sweeping theories of presidential powers to bypass statutory and treaty constraints, justifying a range of detention, interrogation and surveillance policies. </s> <s> As a candidate, Mr. Obama accused Mr. Bush of undermining the Constitution. </s> <s> After taking office, Mr. Obama ordered strict adherence to antitorture rules; justified his counterterrorism policies as authorized by Congress and consistent with international law, rather than invoking any inherent powers as commander in chief; and sought to handle terrorism cases that arise on domestic soil exclusively through the criminal justice system rather than using the military. </s> <s> Still, Mr. Obama has outraged civil libertarians by keeping in place the outlines of many Bush-era policies, like indefinite detention and military commissions for terrorism suspects. </s> <s> And in the Libya air war and the targeted killing of Mr. Awlaki, he went beyond Mr. Bush@-@s executive-power record. </s> <s> The conventional wisdom on the Republican nomination race has once again shifted. </s> <s> In the span of just two weeks, Mitt Romney has gone from seeming quite vulnerable to the near-inevitable Republican nominee. </s> <s> The odds@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@ attributed to Mr. Romney winning the nomination at the betting market Intrade, which closed at a low of 42 percent on Dec. 13, had shot up to@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@ 72 percent as of Monday night. </s> <s> I don@-@t know that Mr. Romney@-@s stock is mispriced @-@ if anything, it might be a little cheap. </s> <s> It@-@s not that Mr. Romney is all that strong a candidate. </s> <s> But for him to fail to win the nomination,@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@ someone else has to, and it@-@s hard to see who that is. </s> <s> Newt Gingrich has been moving backward in the polls and would have a lot of hurdles to overcome even if he rebounded. </s> <s> Ron Paul@-@s@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@ numbers have been moving upward, but he@-@s arguably more helpful than harmful to Mr. Romney and has little@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@ chance to win the nomination once the field is winnowed down. </s> <s> Jon M.

@-@destiny@-@ @-@I carry a sense of fate, not destiny,@-@ he said during our breakfast@-@, but call it what you will, Gingrich believes his time is now. </s> <s> Back in early 2009, right around the time that Barack Obama was sworn in as president and staggered Republicans were casting about for direction, I asked John Podesta, President Clinton@-@s last chief of staff and a highly regarded Democratic strategist, who would emerge to fill the vacuum of leadership in the Republican Party. </s> <s> Without hesitation, Podesta said he could answer that in two words: Newt Gingrich. </s> <s> No other Republican, he said, had Newt@-@s ability to seize an opening and frame an argument in ways that people could understand. </s> <s> A couple of months later I wrote an article for this magazine about Newt@-@s ascendance, again, within his party. </s> <s> It was during those sprawling conversations that Gingrich, already mulling a presidential run, talked at length about the theories of Arnold Toynbee, the British political scientist who wrote @-@A Study of History. </s> <s> @-@ In particular, Gingrich was taken by the Toynbeean concept of @-@departure and return,@-@ the notion of great leaders leaving or being cast out of their realms, only to roar back triumphantly when the historical moment summoned them. </s> <s> Winston Churchill, Charles de Gaulle, Ronald Reagan @-@ all are idols to Gingrich, men who were humiliated or exiled and then returned as heroes. </s> <s> @-@Reagan never withdrew from public life quite like the other two, but as Gingrich sees it, Reagan@-@s career seemed all but over after he didn@-@t win the nomination in 1976. </s> <s> @-@ In his years after resigning the speakership in 1998, Gingrich came to believe that he, too, was gathering strength for a return. </s> <s> @-@I@-@ve had the time to actually think about what you would do if you wanted to profoundly reset the country,@-@ Gingrich told me in Iowa. </s> <s> There is an unmistakable theme of departure and return in his campaign as well, because just about everyone had written him off as irrelevant by Labor Day. </s> <s> Gingrich sounds rueful when he thinks back to the pounding he took during his first week as a candidate, when he got into trouble with conservatives for criticizing the entitlement-reform plan offered by his friend Paul Ryan. </s> <s> @-@It was the excuse to go after me,@-@ he told me. </s> <s> @-@So everybody said, @-@Oh, good, he@-@s bleeding, let@-@s see if we can@-@t kill him. </s> <s> @-@ And that@-@s what was the real revelation to me, is that people I really thought were personal friends all cheerfully engaged in the lynching. </s> <s> And a lot of them of course now have a vested interest in my not winning, because of how silly they@-@ll all look. </s> <s> @-@Gingrich says now, in what may be a characteristic bit of revisionist history, that it was clear early on that he needed to break free of his highly paid and conventional consultants, and that he and his wife, Callista, actually took their much-maligned Greek vacation last June @-@ a pleasure trip in the middle of what was supposed to be his ramp-up as a candidate @-@ in order to provoke a confrontation with the campaign@-@s leadership. </s> <s> @-@Gingrich later added that he really needed to see the Greek fiscal crisis up close. </s> <s> @-@ If so, it worked, because the entire senior team quit en masse when he got back. </s> <s> Thus cast out into the campaign wilderness, Gingrich persevered through the summer and early fall, despite the mockery of those who considered it a sad final act. </s> <s> A few times, he now admits, he considered quitting. </s> <s> @-@The months of June and July were the hardest in my career,@-@ he told me. </s> <s> @-@You had people you thought you knew and you liked, at places like Fox News, asserting enthusiastically that you were dead. </s> <s> Not sadly @-@ enthusiastically, happily. </s> <s> @-@ He sipped his coffee but looked as if it tasted bitter. </s> <s> @-@One of the things that actually saved us,@-@ Gingrich told me, @-@in addition to Callista@-@s stubbornness, was Ellis the elephant. </s> <s> @-@I checked to make sure I heard this right. </s> <s> Ellis the elephant is the main character in Callista@-@s new children@-@s book, @-@Sweet Land of Liberty,@-@ a New York Times best seller. </s> <s> In what way had a fictional elephant salvaged his presidential campaign? </s> <s> @-@Happy, positive,@-@ Gingrich replied, searching for the right words. </s> <s> @-@Interesting. </s> <s> Creative. </s> <s> It gave you an oasis psychologically. </s> <s> Literally, Ellis was sort of a ray of light. </s> <s> @-@Why Gingrich@-@s campaign rebounded among voters, like so much else about this pre-election year, is a puzzle. </s> <s> The campaign has little organization, nor is there any one discernible message or facile idea to which voters might attach themselves, like Herman Cain@-@s @-@9-9-9@-@ tax plan. </s> <s> @-@True to form, Gingrich has unveiled a lengthy 21st-century Contract With America, which links to a bunch of denser campaign materials, including a 54-page paper on the constitutional limits of judicial authority. </s> <s> @-@ The only plausible explanation lies in a series of impressive debate performances, in which a confident Gingrich remained statesmanlike toward his rivals while simultaneously showering Obama @-@and the debate moderators@-@ with the kind of withering contempt at which he is masterful. </s> <s> Of course, if mere contempt for the establishment were the thing Republican voters were craving, they wouldn@-@t have needed Gingrich to provide it. </s> <s> Bachmann and Perry and Santorum are all pretty solid in that department. </s> <s> What Gingrich provides, and what his liberal critics have always found insanely maddening about him, is a reputation for intellectual depth. </s> <s> Among the candidates, he alone combines contempt with credibility, not just giving voice to conservative fury but also making it sound like a legitimate basis for governing. </s> <s> The sudden surge of the Gingrich campaign, from nowhere to somewhere in a matter of weeks, has exposed the weaknesses of an underfinanced and underorganized operation. </s> <s> The well-attended Gingrich events I saw in Iowa @-@ a meet-and-greet with Hy-Vee supermarket shoppers, a @-@town hall meeting@-@ with no chairs @-@ had a thrown-together and awkward quality. </s> <s> There was no music or introductory speeches. </s> <s> Often Gingrich entered the room to silence or scattered applause, as if dropping in unannounced. </s> <s> @-@Well, that went pretty well, I thought,@-@ Gingrich remarked to an aide after one such event. </s> <s> @-@All of which has surely reinforced some lingering doubts about a man whose discipline and organizational skills have always been in question. </s> <s> Social conservatives, or at least a significant number of them, may eye Gingrich warily because of his messy divorces, but Republican insiders worry more about his reliability as a candidate. </s> <s> Gingrich@-@s rhetoric is sprinkled with the usual Newtian ideas, half brilliant and half wacky, or just plain weird; he says, for instance, that he would force Obama to debate him seven times, for three hours each and without a moderator, by following him everywhere he travels until he relents. </s> <s> Gingrich@-@s esoteric sense of humor sometimes comes through at odd moments, like the one I saw during an appearance at an apparel manufacturer in Hiawatha, where a voter asked Gingrich how he planned to address the Federal Reserve. </s> <s> @-@How would I address the Federal Reserve? </s> <s> @-@ he repeated. </s> <s> @-@Well, let@-@s see. </s> <s> @-@Sir. </s> <s> @-@ @-@Ma@-@am. </s> <s> @-@ @-@ He waited a beat. </s> <s> @-@There are lots of ways to address the Federal Reserve. </s> <s> @-@ Among Republicans, there@-@s never been much doubt that Gingrich has a serious intellect, but there@-@s plenty of debate about whether he is a serious politician, and thus some fear about his electability should he actually become the nominee. </s> <s> Gingrich@-@s main opponents, meanwhile, have been relentlessly reminding voters of his ties to the health care industry and to Freddie Mac, along with his appearance in an ad with Nancy Pelosi to call attention to climate change. </s> <s> Perhaps the most arresting negative ad came from a group calling itself Iowans for Christian Leaders in Government; the spot pummeled Gingrich for refusing to purge the party of candidates who support partial-birth abortions, while viewers watched a fetus rotating in the womb and listened to a song called @-@No Room for the Baby Lord Jesus. </s> <s> @-@In contrast, not only has Gingrich spent far less on TV spots than his rivals have spent on attacking him, but the ads he has run @-@ including a Merry Christmas message from him and Callista @-@ have been so gauzy and positive that they could have run on Nick Jr. and been mistaken for programming. </s> <s> Gingrich, of course, doesn@-@t have the resources@-@ to fight back in kind or to defend himself in all the primary states that are fast approaching, even if he wanted to @-@ and he says he doesn@-@t, preferring to run a Reagan-like positive campaign. </s> <s> There@-@s a considerable oddity here, because a lot of lawmakers in both parties will tell you that Speaker Gingrich played as significant a role as anyone in making politics more personal and vicious. </s> <s> Be that as it may, Gingrich@-@s play now is to convince voters that the attacks are a manifestation of a political status quo they revile. </s> <s> @-@When you walk into the room, you have a choice,@-@ Gingrich told me, explaining his message. </s> <s> @-@You can vote for politics as usual, negativism as usual, consultants as usual, lies as usual. </s> <s> And that@-@s your prerogative. </s> <s> And if you do, you can look in the mirror and you@-@ll know who gave America more of what@-@s made us sick. </s> <s> @-@On the Tuesday before Christmas, at the Al-jon heavy machinery plant in Ottumwa, a man asked Gingrich to defend himself against yet another ad, this one claiming that he was a @-@globalist. </s> <s> @-@ @-@Among Republican primary voters, this is only slightly less incendiary than being called a terrorist. </s> <s> @-@ Gingrich appeared startled, although I doubted he was. </s> <s> @-@I think these guys hire consult@-@ants who sit around and get drunk and write stupid ads,@-@ he said. </s> <s> @-@I am just so fed up with this stuff. </s> <s> @-@A few minutes later, he marched into a roomful of reporters and demanded that Romney renounce the ads his Super-PAC friends were running. </s> <s> Gingrich was at his cutting and didactic best. </s> <s> When he said that his rivals needed to love America enough to stop tearing down other Republicans and helping Obama, a reporter asked him whether it wasn@-@t a bit negative to suggest that other candidates didn@-@t love their country. </s> <s> @-@I didn@-@t say they didn@-@t love America,@-@ he snapped. </s> <s> @-@I said they didn@-@t love America enough. </s> <s> I@-@m sure they love America some. </s> <s> @-@After Gingrich was finished, and after he met with about 20 local business leaders, he and I and a few aides sat down at a conference table outside the plant manager@-@s office. </s> <s> A glass wall overlooked the factory floor, where below we could see two of the company@-@s prized products: a blue machine that recycled scrap metal and an orange one that turned cars into crushed cubes. </s> <s> Gingrich was clearly energized. </s> <s> @-@I@-@m very interested to see what the impact is,@-@ he said of the remarks he just made. </s> <s> Callista came in bearing a tray of cookies, which she put on the table. </s> <s> @-@Ho, ho, ho! </s> <s> @-@ Gingrich exclaimed. </s> <s> As he smiled and ate one with M@-@M@-@s, I reminded him that a month or so earlier, he himself wondered whether he was a top-tier candidate to stay, or merely the latest fad. </s> <s> The polls that showed him plummeting couldn@-@t be encouraging. </s> <s> @-@They@-@re not particularly discouraging,@-@ Gingrich said. </s> <s> @-@I think it@-@s going to take another month of shakeout to see. </s> <s> Obviously unanswered nastiness has an effect. </s> <s> I clearly have eroded here much more significantly. </s> <s> @-@Gingrich@-@s strategy is clear enough. </s> <s> He wants to be the last guy standing against Romney after the first few contests @-@ something that could be achieved just by finishing strongly enough in the early states to garner some attention while, one by one, his rivals run out of reasons to stay in the race. </s> <s> Gingrich knows he isn@-@t any social conservative@-@s dream, and maybe the Tea Party types are put off by his personal life or his ties to big business. </s> <s> But he@-@s betting that they like Romney even less and will rally behind him in a two-man race. </s> <s> @-@This is the classic fight between the moderate Republicans who try to get to the middle by compromise and the conservative Republicans who try to create a new middle by driving the left away,@-@ he said. </s> <s> This seemed as plausible as any other theory of the moment, although the last few days in Iowa had left me somewhat dubious. </s> <s> Several of the voters I met at Gingrich@-@s events seemed to be reluctantly getting their heads around voting for Romney. </s> <s> It wasn@-@t that they appreciated his less-confrontational brand of Republicanism any more than they did six months ago. </s> <s> It was that they had heard out all the other candidates, and they were starting to think that Romney was the only guy who could actually get himself elected. </s> <s> I asked Gingrich about his electability problem, and he rehearsed for me the arguments he would make to Republican voters @-@ that at this stage in 1979 Reagan was losing to Jimmy Carter by 30 points @-@actually, it was more like 25@-@, that @-@somebody who believes passionately in something beats somebody who@-@s timid and calculating. </s> <s> @-@ Then he grew more reflective. </s> <s> @-@I only exist because the country is in trouble,@-@ Gingrich said. </s> <s> @-@The question is whether I can in fact help the country work its way out of trouble. </s> <s> If we had 4 percent unemployment and no foreign threat, I couldn@-@t be a candidate. </s> <s> It would be absurd. </s> <s> There are 20 guys you could pick in peaceful, calm and pleasant times who would be adequate as president, none of whom have my liabilities. </s> <s> @-@It was an unusual admission from a presidential candidate near the top of national polls, but it was a candid assessment from a man who thinks of himself in the mold of Churchill or Reagan. </s> <s> The way Newt sees it, fate doesn@-@t hinge on his being a perfect man. </s> <s> Only a great one. </s> <s> @-@ON TUESDAY, perhaps 100,000 to 150,000 Iowans will gather in buildings ranging from high school gymnasiums

advertising barrage, aides are methodically analyzing data on each voter to create the perfect pitch: those worried about illegal immigration, for example, are invited to join a conference call with a border county sheriff in Arizona. </s> <s> At Rick Santorum@-@s offices, two of his college-age children, urgently aware that their father@-@s presidential ambitions could end here, are offering potential voters a homespun message of family values. </s> <s> @-@What can I tell you about my father? </s> <s> @-@ their calls begin. </s> <s> And at the Michele Bachmann operation, lofty aspirations are rapidly fading into a dispiriting reality: the bells that campaign workers are supposed to sound with every new recruit rarely chime. </s> <s> Far from the spotlight of their candidates@-@ events, hundreds of staff members and volunteers are scrambling for an edge in a fierce final effort to tilt the outcome of a contest that has been shifting almost by the day. </s> <s> Beyond the speeches and television commercials, this unglamorous ground war is unfolding with hidden intensity inside forlorn office parks, under pale fluorescent lights and amid grease-stained pizza boxes. </s> <s> Yet in the closing hours, it is the tedious and time-consuming work of identifying voters and persuading them to show up at Tuesday night@-@s caucuses, the first contest of the 2012 primary race, that could make the difference among Republicans who cannot seem to make up their minds. </s> <s> As the days dwindle and the pressure rises, these behind-the-scenes deliberations and strategies offer telling insights about the state of the race, the strength of the campaigns and the personality of the candidates. </s> <s> There is the quirky insularity of Ron Paul supporters, skittish in their bow ties and fleece jackets, content to keep opponents guessing as to whether they should be feared or ignored. </s> <s> There is the triple-checked orderliness of the Romney campaign and the good-humored chaos of the Gingrich operation. </s> <s> Though the onetime front-runner Rick Perry flaunts his deep pockets on the airwaves here, perhaps a more revealing assessment of his status can be found written on the walls at Gingrich headquarters, where Mr. Perry is the only one of six candidates reduced to a humbling shorthand: @-@Other. </s> <s> @-@And while the lights were off and the doors locked at the Bachmann headquarters the other night, there was a renewed sense of possibility at Mr. Santorum@-@s office, up and running past midnight, where staff members have been dismissing the once pervasive questions about electability with increasing confidence. </s> <s> @-@I don@-@t know if you saw the poll that came out tonight? </s> <s> @-@ one Santorum worker said to a voter. </s> <s> In a big, sparsely populated state, where knocking on doors is impractical, the crucial tool of campaigning is the trusty telephone. </s> <s> Every evening, campaigns are following the time-tested method of packing volunteers into their headquarters to place as many phone calls as possible. </s> <s> The energy level in these rooms, however, varies considerably. </s> <s> Inside Mrs. Bachmann@-@s office near Des Moines, a political adviser laid out an ambitious plan for the final week. </s> <s> The campaign would tap an army of supporters to call 25,000 undecided Iowa voters who could make the difference between a respectable or an embarrassing finish. </s> <s> On this night, it was off to a rocky start. </s> <s> There were only three volunteers working the phones. </s> <s> One struggled with her computer, then took an hourlong dinner break. </s> <s> Another dialed a Bachmann donor, who promptly told her he was no longer interested in the candidate. </s> <s> @-@He@-@s been watching her the entire time, but just thinks that Gingrich will make a better president,@-@ she explained to her fellow volunteers. </s> <s> @-@I am not going to argue with people. </s> <s> @-@During nearly an hour of technological troubles and busy signals, the reception bells placed on every desk to provide an audible record of progress rang just once. </s> <s> Over at Mr. Santorum@-@s office, volunteers targeting many of the same religious voters as Mrs. Bachmann routinely reach 200 people a day each using a high-tech phone system that automatically dialed calls, classified responses and displayed a script for volunteers to read: @-@Would you be interested in helping Rick Santorum in Iowa? </s> <s> @-@ At the nearby Gingrich headquarters, it was not energy that was lacking so much as time. </s> <s> The new office@-@s staff swelled visibly over the final week as the revived campaign tried to catch up. </s> <s> On Wednesday night, the volunteers were told that the number of calls placed had jumped from 300 on Monday to 3,000 on Wednesday. </s> <s> The case for Mr. Gingrich mostly came from out-of-towners who had flown in from Washington, Virginia and Florida. </s> <s> One woman from Georgia, Sharon Cooper, began each conversation with an unmistakable drawl: @-@I was his state representative. </s> <s> @-@Some committed instantly; more hung up. </s> <s> One woman advised that her husband had died and would not be voting. </s> <s> Another lamented that the race had no @-@old-fashioned Republican. </s> <s> @-@ And after a few minutes of arm-twisting, an undecided voter requested a Gingrich lawn sign because, he told the volunteer, @-@you@-@re a nice guy and you@-@re a human being, not a robot. </s> <s> @-@An elderly man said he was a longtime supporter of Mr. Gingrich but hedged when asked if he planned to take part in a caucus. </s> <s> @-@It probably depends a lot on the weather,@-@ he said. </s> <s> The practiced response was swift: @-@What would it take to get you out if the weather is bad? </s> <s> @-@If someone comes to get us,@-@ the man responded. </s> <s> @-@Well, we@-@ll definitely send someone to pick you up and drive you to the caucus. </s> <s> @-@The weather forecast for Tuesday: partly cloudy with a high of 35 degrees. </s> <s> Caution Every candidate for the Republican nomination has campaigned at Pizza Ranch, a beloved restaurant chain in Iowa with strong ties to the Christian right. </s> <s> Every candidate except Mr. Romney. </s> <s> His campaign prides itself on a vigilance and meticulousness bordering on the obsessive. </s> <s> So before Mr. Romney appears at a campaign stop or accepts an endorsement, his staff conducts sometimes painstaking vetting to avoid potentially embarrassing disclosures. </s> <s> A founder of Pizza Ranch, it turned out, spent time in prison on charges of sexually abusing male employees. </s> <s> @-@There is not a lot of room for mistakes,@-@ said David Kochel, Mr. Romney@-@s top strategist in Iowa. </s> <s> While Mr. Romney has been caricatured for his cautious style, Mr. Paul @-@ and his devoted supporters @-@ have been known for dispensing with convention. </s> <s> But as Mr. Paul@-@s recent poll numbers have raised the once unthinkable prospect of an impressive showing in Iowa, his campaign has suddenly taken on a defensive posture. </s> <s> At his campaign rallies, supporters and staff members, who once complained about being ignored by the news media, now declare that they are prohibited from talking to the press, muttering about @-@operationally sensitive@-@ campaign work. </s> <s> @-@I can@-@t talk to you,@-@ one of them said over his shoulder, after a group of Paul volunteers scattered at the sight of a journalist the other night. </s> <s> Poll numbers capture the attention of the public. </s> <s> But among political staff members here a single metric is prized above all else: the number of people recruited to deliver the candidate@-@s impassioned final arguments to voters on caucus night. </s> <s> The wide gap between the figures for Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Santorum say much about their organizations in Iowa, which has more than 1,700 precincts. </s> <s> As of midweek, Mr. Santorum, who traipsed to even the most rural of Iowa@-@s 99 counties over many months, had secured speakers in 1,000 of the precincts. </s> <s> Mr. Gingrich, who opened an office here only a few weeks ago, had nailed down about only 200. </s> <s> Though that number had doubled by the end of the next day, Mr. Gingrich@-@s own aides acknowledged that the shortage of speakers could be a problem. </s> <s> @-@Iowans have a deep belief in organization,@-@ said April Linder, a staff member, @-@and when you don@-@t have a speaker, it shows a lack of organization. </s> <s> @-@ The aide responsible for recruiting caucus speakers for Mr. Perry in Des Moines said he had tried to stay upbeat even as his candidate@-@s popularity lurched up and down. </s> <s> @-@You have to stay very enthusiastic,@-@ said the aide, Rob Anderson. </s> <s> @-@You@-@re selling a candidate, and you@-@re never going to sell a candidate if you@-@re down in the dumps. </s> <s> @-@ After Mr. Perry gave a speech at a local restaurant, Mr. Anderson worked to slow the tide of exiting guests. </s> <s> Most hurried by, but enough signed up to speak on behalf of Mr. Perry that he ran out of the extra large T-shirts that he was giving them to wear on caucus night. </s> <s> The next day, the volunteers who signed up streamed in to the Perry headquarters, including Mary Secress, a retired administrative assistant. </s> <s> She said she had never made a speech but was not worried about what to say. </s> <s> @-@They@-@ve got everything written down for us,@-@ she said. </s> <s> @-@ Sticking to the Plan The speeches provided by the campaigns to their supporters for caucus night leave virtually nothing to chance. </s> <s> Even the opening greetings are scripted. </s> <s> @-@What a great day to be an Iowan! </s> <s> @-@ begins a speech provided to Romney backers. </s> <s> It is not hard to match the scripts with the candidates they are intended to help. </s> <s> The tone, complexity and even length are often familiar. </s> <s> Written in punchy bullet points, the Perry campaign speech describes him as @-@the son of tenant farmers@-@ and @-@America@-@s most pro-life governor. </s> <s> @-@ The Romney speech, thick with dense prose, calls him @-@the toughest opponent@-@ for President Obama who would @-@never do anything as president that would embarrass the office, or the country. </s> <s> @-@ The script about Mr. Santorum, sounding at times like a sermon, quotes Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh and calls Mr. Santorum @-@the Tea Party candidate before there was a Tea Party. </s> <s> @-@There are striking, almost comical similarities as well. </s> <s> Mr. Perry is a @-@conservative outsider. </s> <s> @-@ Mr. Romney is a @-@conservative businessman. </s> <s> @-@ And Mr. Santorum is a @-@conservative warrior. </s> <s> @-@ Packing the Airwaves The frenzy of activity is aimed at a self-selected, relatively small number of caucusgoers. </s> <s> For all their political import, the Iowa caucuses, for many, are a time-consuming hassle. </s> <s> As opposed to the quick pull of a lever at a polling station, upwards of an hour of the participants@-@ evening must be devoted to a spirited public debate in a gymnasium, restaurant or living room.12 PhotosView Slide Show @-@No wonder that in a state with a population of three million, fewer than 120,000 Republicans participated in 2008 @-@ just 4 percent. </s> <s> This campaign season, the already stiff competition for these hardy few participants has intensified because the Republican Party abandoned its winner-take-all system, meaning that even losing candidates can win delegates. </s> <s> So undecided caucusgoers are being bombarded. </s> <s> The Santorum campaign, for example, contacts each undecided voter it has identified at least six times. </s> <s> As soon as a new flier arrives in the mail, the campaign calls to ask if the recipient was swayed. </s> <s> @-@Every single one of them has given me a phone call more than once, and I@-@m really not a fan of Michele Bachmann constantly e-mailing me,@-@ said Aimee Davis, a stay-at- home mother. </s> <s> @-@I@-@m almost tempted to go back to being an independent just to stop getting calls. </s> <s> @-@The campaigns pursue Iowans of every conceivable niche. </s> <s> To court female voters in the state, the Romney campaign invited thousands of them to listen in by phone as Mr. Romney@-@s wife, Ann, recounted her loving marriage and family life. </s> <s> Active party members draw even more attention. </s> <s> The crowd shuffling into a meeting of the Polk County Republican Committee found each chair littered with a stack of fliers promoting Mr. Paul or Mr. Gingrich. </s> <s> A representative from each campaign briefly addressed the crowd. </s> <s> @-@I@-@d expect all the campaigns that are serious about running in Iowa to have a representative here,@-@ said David Fischer, the state co-chairman for Mr. Paul. </s> <s> While in this state the premium has always been on the shaken hand and patted back, there are of course the more traditional @-@ and just as intrusive @-@ staples of a modern campaign. </s> <s> The airwaves are packed with a night-and-day loop of television advertisements @-@Mr. Perry has spent the most, @-@2.2 million@-@, and candidates are doing the obligatory digital outreach @-@Mr. Romney leads on Facebook, and Mr. Gingrich on Twitter@-@. </s> <s> But the indecision among those who intend to vote can be exasperating for the campaigns. </s> <s> Consider Polly Carver-Kimm, 48, who walked out of a breakfast meeting of local Republicans the other day with lawn signs for two different candidates, Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Perry. </s> <s> @-@We@-@re going to put them both in our yard until we decide,@-@ said Ms. Carver-Kimm, who works as a spokeswoman for the state health department. </s> <s> @-@Then we@-@ll take one down. </s> <s> @-@ The Final Push Located on a main retail drag in Des Moines, Mr. Romney@-@s headquarters is bright, big and glassy. </s> <s> The others, in the more Republican suburbs, require a drive of 15 minutes or longer to drab buildings in strip malls and office parks. </s> <s> But they all stand out for their improvised, personal touches. </s> <s> A whiteboard on the wall at the Perry campaign celebrated a dated victory: @-@Cain Train 2012,@-@ and underneath, @-@derailed. </s> <s> @-@ Michele Bachmann@-@s husband, Marcus, has hung a hand-written poster proclaiming his love for his wife. </s> <s> The lobby of Mr.

their showdown over extending payroll tax cuts and unemployment aid for two months. </s> <s> But he got a lot politically: a big start toward retiring the perception @-@ fair or not, and even among Democrats @-@ that in a pinch with the other party he will inevitably surrender. </s> <s> That perception had dogged Mr. Obama for much of the year since gains by Republicans in the 2010 midterm elections gave them control of the House and a share of power in Washington. </s> <s> But it became threatening, both to Mr. Obama@-@s leverage with Congress and to his prospects for re-election, after the epic summer fight over raising the nation@-@s debt limit. </s> <s> In September, the White House set out to change the image of Mr. Obama from compromiser in chief to determined voice of economic populism, beginning a push for a job-creation plan that it viewed as a win-win. </s> <s> Either Mr. Obama would pass his plan @-@ which was not likely given Republican opposition both to additional stimulus measures and to the higher taxes on the wealthy that he proposed to offset the package@-@s cost @-@ or he would get political credit for trying, given the popularity of the plan@-@s individual provisions. </s> <s> And he would make it clear that Republicans would obstruct anything he proposed, especially if it meant higher taxes on the rich. </s> <s> What surprised the administration, and not least Mr. Obama, was how much House Republicans would contribute toward the White House@-@s goal through their miscalculations in waging this holiday-season showdown over tax cuts for 160 million workers and assistance for several million jobless Americans. </s> <s> The stand by House Republicans, which openly divided the party and put them in conflict with Senate Republicans, helped Mr. Obama perhaps as much as anything the White House and Congressional Democrats did. </s> <s> Vin Weber, a Republican Party strategist and former congressman, acknowledged that Mr. Obama had won at least @-@a nice tactical victory to end the year@-@ as well as higher approval ratings in recent polls. </s> <s> Mr. Weber said he learned long ago from a pollster to President Ronald Reagan that @-@one of the central ingredients of a president@-@s approval rating is the public@-@s sense of his ability to dominate Congress. </s> <s> @-@The substantive issues,@-@ he said, @-@are secondary. </s> <s> @-@What Republicans in the House didn@-@t understand @-@ and I love these guys by and large @-@ but what they didn@-@t understand is that you don@-@t fight every issue,@-@ Mr. Weber added. </s> <s> @-@And if you@-@re going to fight an issue like this, you@-@re going to give him a victory and hurt yourself in the process. </s> <s> @-@As glum and divided as Republicans were at the outcome, Democrats were celebrating that Mr. Obama had stuck by the united front he forged with them this fall. </s> <s> @-@The White House must feel pretty good about muscling home a victory for the middle class,@-@ said John Podesta, chairman of the liberal Center for American Progress and a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. </s> <s> @-@And importantly for the fights of 2012, they learned those muscles work. </s> <s> @-@Congressional Democrats have long been suspicious that Mr. Obama was too eager to cut deals with Republicans that would benefit him politically but not his party @-@ by reducing Medicare and Social Security spending, for example, to get a so-called grand budget bargain. </s> <s> But this week they freely credited him with the victory, for his persistence and his refusal in the endgame to negotiate with House Republicans. </s> <s> An aide to Congressional Democratic leaders said, @-@The White House just went all in and closed off the House G. O. P.@-@s hoped-for exit ramp@-@ that is, Republicans@-@ belief that Mr. Obama would ultimately would give in rather than risk blame if payroll taxes went up for millions on Jan. 1. </s> <s> For the White House, which has long chafed at the criticism that Mr. Obama has been a soft touch for Congressional Republicans, the outcome was vindication. </s> <s> Last December, liberal Democrats were outraged when Mr. Obama agreed to extend the expiring Bush-era tax cuts for the rich by an additional two years, after having campaigned to end them. </s> <s> The White House said that was the price to get Republicans, who were newly emboldened by their election victories, to support a one-year payroll tax cut and extended unemployment aid @-@ without which, the administration and many economists believed, the economy could tip into another recession. </s> <s> Most galling to the White House, however, has been the lingering criticism from Democratic insiders and grass-roots supporters alike about the August debt-limit deal. </s> <s> In that compromise, Mr. Obama accepted deep spending cuts but Republicans blocked any tax increases. </s> <s> Mr. Obama had no choice but to compromise then, his aides argued; the nation risked economic calamity if it could no longer borrow to pay its debts, and Mr. Obama@-@s Republican adversaries professed to be willing to see that happen. </s> <s> Even so, administration officials said, the deal was not only better than the critics suggested but it helped set the trap that House Republicans walked into this month. </s> <s> The deal increased the debt ceiling through 2012, not to this month as some Republicans had wanted, and thereby removed the threat of default from Republicans@-@ end-of-the-year bargaining arsenal. </s> <s> With the stakes much lower, after August Mr. Obama was liberated to press a harder bargain. </s> <s> Starting in September with his jobs package, he did. </s> <s> @-@For the first time I think you see a kind of consistency and coherency in terms of an economic message,@-@ Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said of Mr. Obama. </s> <s> @-@The pivot point was the jobs speech, and the jobs speech occurred after he had dealt with the extension of the tax cuts and dealt with the debt ceiling. </s> <s> Those two things freed him up to do what he@-@s been doing. </s> <s> @-@ Also a factor was the hard lesson Mr. Obama learned from his past negotiations with Speaker John A. Boehner, first in the spring talks over this year@-@s domestic spending and then in their summer effort for the grand bargain to reduce long-term debt: Mr. Boehner cannot deliver his defiantly antigovernment and Tea Party-inspired majority in the House. </s> <s> When that proved true yet again, Mr. Obama was bolstered just as Mr. Boehner was further undermined. </s> <s> Whether Mr. Obama continues to play a strong hand will be tested soon @-@ when Congress reconvenes in January to resume the fight over a full-year extension. </s> <s> By Jeff ZelenyDES MOINES @-@ Mitt Romney and his allies are making an assertive final push this week to increase his chances of a strong finish in the Iowa caucuses, the outcome of which could help determine the length of the Republican presidential nominating battle. </s> <s> Any questions about whether Mr. Romney is playing to win in Iowa will be dispelled in the closing days of campaigning here. </s> <s> He introduced a new TV commercial on Monday, promoting his economic vision and his family values @-@ a message that is fortified by a hard-hitting punch from a well-financed outside group attacking two of his rivals. </s> <s> @-@It is a moral imperative for America to stop spending more money than we take in,@-@ Mr. Romney says in the ad, which will be running when he arrives in Iowa on Tuesday for a bus tour and an orchestrated blitz of appearances by surrogates leading up to the caucuses on Jan. 3. </s> <s> While the future of Mr. Romney@-@s candidacy does not depend on an Iowa victory, his advisers believe that his prospects are better than they once expected. </s> <s> The factors include arguments that he would be his party@-@s strongest candidate against President Obama, divisions among social conservatives about which candidate to support and the challenges facing Newt Gingrich and his still bare-bones campaign organization, highlighted by his failure last week to qualify for the Virginia primary ballot. </s> <s> The strength of Representative Ron Paul of Texas, who has built a dedicated band of supporters, and the rising candidacy here of Rick Santorum are among the ingredients fueling a volatile final week before the Iowa caucuses kick off the first round of voting. </s> <s> The race could be susceptible to unforeseen turns and missteps, but a consensus is gathering among top Republicans that the advantages for Mr. Romney are growing. </s> <s> @-@If the evangelical vote is splintered and Ron Paul@-@s people aren@-@t going anywhere, Mitt Romney could end up winning the Iowa caucuses as a result,@-@ said Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor who defeated Mr. Romney here in the 2008 caucuses. </s> <s> @-@It would not put me on the floor if that happened. </s> <s> @-@Yet interviews with voters across Iowa reinforce the finding of polls that suggest a majority of Republicans who plan to attend the caucuses are still open to changing their minds over the coming days. </s> <s> The race, which is also being influenced by the cross-fire of several candidates who are fighting to keep their presidential aspirations alive, including Gov. </s> <s> Rick Perry of Texas and Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, remains as unsettled in its closing days as any round of Iowa caucuses in recent memory. </s> <s> Here is a look at a few factors shaping the closing chapter of the preseason race:The Gingrich ChallengeWhen the final Republican presidential debate of 2011 took place on Dec. 15 in Sioux City, Iowa, Mr. Gingrich lost his best platform for the rest of the year. </s> <s> His strong performance in a series of televised debates had breathed new life into his candidacy, but he has struggled to build a campaign structure to fend off a barrage of attacks from Mr. Romney, Mr. Paul and Mr. Perry and ensure that his supporters turn out on caucus night. </s> <s> He has loudly criticized the negative advertising against him, but his complaints have received far less attention than the attacks on various elements of his long public career. </s> <s> He has declined to say how much money he has raised in recent months, but the fact that he has not responded with a vigorous ad campaign suggests that he cannot afford to do so. </s> <s> Even as he made plans for a closing sprint through Iowa in which he will try to draw clearer contrasts with Mr. Romney on economic policy, Mr. Gingrich has tried to lower expectations about his showing here, saying that his strategy is to place in the top three or four in Iowa and New Hampshire and then win in South Carolina on Jan. 21 and in Florida 10 days later. </s> <s> @-@Negative campaigning works at some point, and the electorate does listen to those things,@-@ said Kraig Paulsen, the speaker of the Iowa House, who endorsed Mr. Gingrich last week. </s> <s> @-@If you say something often enough, some people will start to believe it.@-@Mr. </s> <s> Gingrich has endured more attacks than any other candidate. </s> <s> During local news broadcasts here last week at breakfast, lunch or dinnertime, barely a commercial break went by when several advertisements did not mention ethics charges against him from his time as House speaker, his @-@1.6 million payments from the mortgage giant Freddie Mac or his three marriages. </s> <s> The criticism is even more stinging in fliers that have arrived in mailboxes across Iowa. </s> <s> But Mr. Gingrich@-@s record, including his willingness to work across the aisle on big issues facing the nation, also appeals to some voters as they look for a candidate who can both hold his own in a campaign against Mr. Obama and address partisan paralysis in Washington. </s> <s> Kim Reem, a Republican activist in Cedar Rapids, studied the pros and cons of the candidates and came to the conclusion last week that Mr. Gingrich@-@s history of forging bipartisan deals could be an advantage. </s> <s> She said that a flier from the Romney campaign, which showed Mr. Gingrich sitting alongside Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, in support of action to curb global warming, pushed her toward @-@ not away from @-@ Mr. </s> <s> Gingrich. </s> <s> @-@It seems like the word @-@compromise@-@ has become a dirty word or an ugly word in politics, but I think it@-@s a very important part of the process,@-@ Ms. Reem said. </s> <s> @-@We need someone with a track record of bringing polar opposites together. </s> <s> @-@Santorum RisingMr. </s> <s> Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, has logged more miles in Iowa than any of his rivals. </s> <s> He went pheasant hunting on Monday in central Iowa and invited reporters along to talk afterward. </s> <s> He is one of the few contenders who has not had at least a fleeting moment in the spotlight, but that seems to be changing in the final days of the race. </s> <s> His brightening prospects, Republicans here believe, have kept social conservatives from coalescing around Mr. Gingrich. </s> <s> And that, in turn, could help Mr. Romney. </s> <s> As Mr. Santorum made his way to all 99 counties in the state, becoming the first candidate to do so, he built up a reservoir of good will from voters as he patiently took questions and explained his conservative views. </s> <s> Even his most ardent supporters do not necessarily expect a victory, but several endorsements have provided a measure of validation. </s> <s> Not only did he win the support of Bob Vander Plaats, an influential leader among evangelical voters, but he also won the approval of respected voices in all corners of the state, including noted pastors and radio announcers like Sam Clovis in Sioux City, who last week announced on his popular morning talk show in conservative northwestern Iowa that he was supporting Mr. Santorum. </s> <s> He urged his listeners to do the same. </s> <s> Alan R. Ostergren, the Muscatine County attorney, has been an admirer since Mr. Santorum@-@s visit to his county this year. </s> <s> @-@When I look at what Santorum has,@-@ Mr. Ostergren said, @-@he matches the best of my views of the world. </s> <s> @-@While Mr. Santorum has only recently started advertising on television and his commercials are significantly less frequent than those of Mr. Romney or Mr. Perry, his efforts are now being bolstered by a @-@super PAC@-@ that is running a positive campaign promoting him as the @-@true conservative@-@ in the race. </s> <s> Outside InfluencesThe Iowa caucuses may not be a reliable predictor of who will win the Republican nomination, as Mr. Huckabee could attest from his experience in 2008. </s> <s> But if nothing else, they are proving a high-stakes test for a new generation of political groups @-@ the super PACS, which under a 2010 Supreme Court ruling can advocate on behalf of a candidate with fewer disclosure requirements and fund-raising limits than the candidates themselves face, as long as the groups do not coordinate with the campaigns they are backing. </s> <s> The assumption had been that the groups, often run by close associates of the candidates, would take on the dirty work of tearing down opponents. </s> <s> In Iowa over the last few weeks, that assumption has proved correct, with implications not just for the outcome here, but also for how the rest of the campaign will unfold. </s> <s> While Mr. Romney has kept his own television advertising largely positive, the main group working to elect him, Restore Our Future, has trained intense fire on Mr. Gingrich, which has probably contributed to his decline in polls. </s> <s> Mr. Perry has also been a target of the group, with an eye on severely wounding him so he is less of a threat in South Carolina and Florida. </s> <s> Mr. Paul has been the most aggressive in assailing Mr. Gingrich. </s> <s> A minute-long ad accusing Mr. Gingrich of @-@serial hypocrisy@-@ plays again and again on television against a backdrop of dramatic music and black-and-white images that suggest he profited extensively from his time as House speaker. </s> <s> For his part, Mr. Perry has sought to paint Mr. Romney as @-@Wall Street@-@ and Mr. Gingrich as @-@K Street@-@ and to highlight their previous support for health care mandates. </s> <s> The pointed criticism of Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich could damage both of them, Republicans say, allowing for a rival to unexpectedly emerge in the waning days of the race here. </s> <s> @-@If you have a knife fight going on, another candidate can slip through the back door and under the curtain,@-@ Mr. Huckabee, who is neutral in the race, said in an interview. </s> <s> @-@Sometimes there are unintended consequences of a negative campaign. </s> <s> @-@OrganizationIn the closing burst of campaigning before voters gather at 1,774 precincts across Iowa next week to choose their top Republican candidate, several uncertainties remain, chief among them, the size of the turnout and whether Republicans will spontaneously decide to attend the caucuses out of a desire to win back the White House. </s> <s> If a traditional organization is needed to entice voters to show up, Mr. Paul could hold an advantage. </s> <s> While Mr. Paul@-@s state campaign headquarters are in the Des Moines area, a satellite office opened by volunteers was bustling last week along Main Street in the small eastern Iowa town of Maquoketa, a three-hour drive from the capital. </s> <s> Hand-printed signs decorated the storefront window, providing precise instructions, with addresses and maps, about where to vote on Jan. 3 @-@ a level of detail that could provide a challenge to his rivals@-@ organizations. </s> <s> Mr. Paul@-@s campaign has also recruited independents and Democrats to register as Republicans @-@ for one night, at least @-@ and support him at the caucuses. </s> <s> In conversations with more than a dozen top Republican strategists, one theme for what to look for in the final week of the Iowa caucus campaign became clear: will any candidate start taking aim at Mr. Paul in paid advertising, following up on Mr. Gingrich@-@s attacks on his foreign policy last week? </s> <s> It is not expected from Mr. Romney, who could also find reason to cheer a victory by Mr. Paul, aides say, because it could devalue the outcome and, more important, mean that one of his leading rivals did not win. </s> <s> By Richard A.

would fly around Iowa to Representative Ron Paul@-@s campaign events in the weeks before the Jan. 3 caucuses, telling reporters at each location that the congressman@-@s foreign policy and military positions were dangerous and na@-@ve. </s> <s> The deal never came to pass. </s> <s> But it reflects both Republican establishment concern about his insurgent candidacy @-@ polls now place Mr. Paul,

of the officers approached by the businessman, whom he declined to identify but who lives in a state neighboring Iowa. </s> <s> Lieutenant Lucas says of Mr. Paul, @-@We cannot afford to give him a

pre-emptive strikes against Iran @-@ are so far out of the Republican orthodoxy that they will limit his support in many places, or, as many in the party argue, make him unelectable in important early-nominating states like South Carolina and Florida. </s> <s> One recent national poll by ABC News and The Washington Post found that 45 percent of Republicans and independents who lean Republican

S. politics. </s> <s> A divided government may be ingrained:@-@ At the presidential level, Democrats start with a decided advantage. </s> <s> Changing demographics @-@ more Hispanics and other minorities solidly behind the party; women and young voters moving that way and forming hard-to-break voting habits @-@ cut the Democrats@-@ way. </s> <s> The electoral map that decides U. S. presidential contests tilts Democratic. </s> <s> President Barack Obama won the national popular vote by 3.7 percentage points, and carried the electoral map @-@ the number of electors from each state is based indirectly on population @-@ 332 to 206. </s> <s> If you took 1.9 percentage points from Mr. Obama and added them to Mitt Romney@-@s tally, the Republican would have won the popular vote by more than 125,000 votes. </s> <s> Yet if that formula were then applied to every state in the country, the only ones that would change would be Florida and Ohio. </s> <s> Mr. Obama would have lost the popular vote but would still have won the Electoral College vote, 285 to 253, and thus the presidency. </s> <s> This is why some states that are reliably Democratic at the presidential level and where Republicans now control the statehouses are trying to change the Electoral College system. </s> <s> Each state controls its own rules. </s> <s> Only two, Maine and Nebraska, award electors by congressional district; everywhere else, it@-@s winner-takes-all. </s> <s> Republicans are pondering a shift to the approach used in Maine and Nebraska. </s> <s> They see a possible test case in Pennsylvania, where Mr. Obama won the popular vote by more than five percentage points, rolling up huge margins in Philadelphia and its suburbs and in Pittsburgh. </s> <s> Mr. Romney, however, carried 13 of the 18 congressional districts. </s> <s> If this new system were in effect, the Republicans would have gotten 13 of the state@-@s 20 electoral votes while getting trounced in the popular vote. </s> <s> If this occurred in mainly Republican states, it would erase the Democrats@-@ Electoral College advantage. </s> <s> In elections for the House of Representatives, Republicans already have a structural advantage. </s> <s> Democratic voters, especially minorities, tend to be bunched into a relatively small number of districts. </s> <s> @-@The high-density Democratic population makes it more difficult for Democrats to create more competitive districts,@-@ said Nathan Gonzales, congressional analyst for the Rothenberg Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter on U. S. politics. </s> <s> It@-@s this bunching, more than any redistricting edge, that enabled Republicans to retain a lead of 234 seats to 201 in the House of Representatives this year even though Democrats received a million more votes over all in House races. </s> <s> There is little to suggest this advantage will lessen in the years ahead. </s> <s> Conventions matter more than debates:@-@ The news media treat the national political conventions as irrelevant dinosaurs; the presidential debates are depicted as the Super Bowl or World Cup of politics. </s> <s> It didn@-@t work out that way this year. </s> <s> The conventions mattered more. </s> <s> Mr. Romney and the Republicans blew a chance at the convention in Tampa, Florida, to reset his candidacy. </s> <s> At their convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Democrats stepped up to the challenge, especially with a powerful speech by former President Bill Clinton that set the basis for more positive public attitudes about the U. S. economy. </s> <s> Mr. Obama@-@s disastrous performance in his first debate with Mr. Romney certainly mattered, though the duration of the Republican nominee@-@s bounce was exaggerated. </s> <s> Before that debate, the president was about four points ahead nationally; that was close to his final margin. </s> <s> Moving to the center is tough in the media age:@-@ Richard M. Nixon advised Republicans to run to the right in the primaries and to quickly move to the center in the general election. </s> <s> This formula worked as recently as 1980 for Ronald Reagan. </s> <s> For Democrats, the formula is to run to the left in the primaries and to move to the center in the general election. </s> <s> This is much harder to do today with the omnipresent news media tracking and assembling every public pronouncement and policy change. </s> <s> Mr. Romney tried to pivot after the primaries; there is little evidence that it worked well. </s> <s> He couldn@-@t escape earlier assertions that had alienated Hispanics @-@calling for undocumented workers to choose self-deportation@-@ or women @-@boasting that he would end U. S. government funding for Planned Parenthood@-@. </s> <s> There are polls @-@ and polls:@-@ Polls done on the cheap, automatic phone calls, some online surveys and partisan polls all missed the mark. </s> <s> More professional polls, with telephone interviews, conducted for the news media and other sources, were accurate in most instances. </s> <s> Campaigns matter:@-@ Improving attitudes about the economy and, to a small degree, the president@-@s response to Hurricane Sandy, moved the needle in the closing weeks. </s> <s> Mr. Obama was indisputably a better political candidate. </s> <s> The contrasting campaigns widened the margin. </s> <s> Post-election forums at Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania, and the campaign e-book @-@The End of the Line,@-@ by Jonathan Martin and Glenn Thrush of the Web site Politico, illustrated the Obama campaign@-@s supremacy on tactics: polling, the use of digital and social media, advertising, identifying voters and getting them to the polls. </s> <s> The biggest advantage was overarching, strategic. </s> <s> @-@We knew who our guy was and where the country was,@-@ said Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Obama@-@s deputy campaign manager. </s> <s> @-@They didn@-@t seem to have a sense of either. </s> <s> @-@ How small-business issues are shaping politics and policy. </s> <s> The news from the National Federation of Independent Business on Tuesday was grim, very grim indeed. </s> <s> Confidence among small-business owners @-@ or, more precisely, among a certain@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@ subset of small-business owners @-@ dropped precipitously in November, as gauged by the organization@-@s Small Business Optimism Index. </s> <s> And the reason for the pessimism, said the N.

Bush@-@s presidency, majorities of Democrats expressed a hopeful outlook. </s> <s> Independents splits about evenly between hope and fear. </s> <s> @-@These people need a hug. </s> <s> Much of this discontent is undoubtedly tied to President Obama@-@s trouncing of Mitt Romney in November. </s> <s> To add insult to injury, Gallup found last week that President Obama@-@s approval rating was at its highest level since October of 2009. </s> <s> In the meantime, Mitt Romney@-@s son Tagg @-@ the one who joked that he wanted to @-@take a swing@-@ at the president after one of the debates @-@ told The Boston Globe last week that his father @-@wanted to be president less than anyone I@-@ve met in my life. </s> <s> He had no desire to .@-@.@-@. </s> <s> run. </s> <s> @-@ He continued, @-@If he could have found someone else to take his place .@-@.@-@. </s> <s> he would have been ecstatic to step aside. </s> <s> @-@ Ouch. </s> <s> That has to hurt Romney@-@s ardent supporters, especially those who invested their time and money in his candidacy. </s> <s> In the words of the R @-@ B singer Usher, @-@let it burn. </s> <s> @-@Little seemed to go right for Republicans in November, including their callous attempts to suppress turnout among minority voters. </s> <s> In fact, there is growing evidence that those efforts backfired spectacularlyAccording to a Pew Research Center report issued on Wednesday, @-@Blacks voted at a higher rate this year than other minority groups and for the first time in history may also have voted at a higher rate than whites. </s> <s> @-@ The report went on to say, @-@these participation milestones are notable not just in light of the long history of black disenfranchisement, but also in light of recently enacted state voter identification laws that some critics contended would suppress turnout disproportionately among blacks and other minority groups. </s> <s> @-@There is nothing like trying to take something away from someone to make that person value it more. </s> <s> The report also found that @-@more Hispanics and Asian-Americans voted than ever before. </s> <s> And their turnout rates also rose. </s> <s> @-@ @-@By comparison, turnout among whites, the only group that Republicans won in 2008 and 2012, fell. </s> <s> Even on the most pressing issues of the moment, Republicans are losing in the court of public opinion. </s> <s> Following the massacre of elementary school children in Connecticut earlier this month, there was an important, although modest, shift in public opinion on gun control, according to another Pew Research Center poll. </s> <s> That poll found that @-@49 percent say it is more important to control gun ownership, while 42 percent say it is more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns. </s> <s> @-@ As the report pointed out, @-@this marks the first time since Barack Obama took office that more Americans prioritize gun control than the right to own guns. </s> <s> @-@ And that poll was taken before the N. R. </s> <s> A. </s> <s> @-@s disastrous news conference on the shooting. </s> <s> Then there are the fiscal cliff negotiations. </s> <s> Polls continue to show that the public approves of the way the president is handling the situation and disapproves of the behavior of the Republicans @-@ and those margins are huge. </s> <s> If we go over the cliff, it is clear that more people will blame Republicans than the president and his party. </s> <s> This may be the season to be jolly, but not if you are a Republican. </s> <s> Op-ChartBy Ben SchottIf, as Soren Kierkegaard believed, life is best understood backward, then the holidays are an ideal time to attempt to unravel the secrets of our age through an end-of-the-year quiz. </s> <s> Below are more than a hundred questions to ponder over a cup of coffee, with your feet up. </s> <s> For, as Kierkegaard also knew, @-@Far from idleness being the root of all evil, it is rather the only true good. </s> <s> @-@ @-@Answers here. </s> <s> @-@MATCH THE TWEET TO THE TWEETER 1. </s> <s> @-@I highly approve of Romney@-@s decision to be kind and gentle to the retard.@-@2. </s> <s> @-@This election is a total sham and a travesty. </s> <s> We are not a democracy!@-@3. </s> <s> @-@One of the biggest pleasures during potato-picking-season was to throw rotten potatoes in the faces of your loved ones.@-@4. </s> <s> @-@GALE CRATER I AM IN YOU!!!@-@5. </s> <s> @-@Uh egrejvvvmhhhkncb vvuk jhugjvklyju hgi@-@yj Ji June v@-@6. </s> <s> @-@RIP Avalanna. </s> <s> i love you@-@7. </s> <s> @-@Dear friends, I am pleased to get in touch with you through Twitter. </s> <s> Thank you for your generous response. </s> <s> I bless all of you from my heart.@-@8. </s> <s> @-@Why is Jewish owned press so consistently anti- Israel in every crisis?@-@QUESTIONS1. </s> <s> Which vessel was captained by Francesco Schettino when it capsized in January?2. </s> <s> To which stars was Blue Ivy Carter born?3. </s> <s> To what speech did Gov. </s> <s> Mitch Daniels of Indiana reply?4. </s> <s> Who sought asylum in Ecuador@-@s London embassy?5. </s> <s> Which publication announced it would go out of print, after 244 years?6. </s> <s> Where was Expo 2012 held?7. </s> <s> Who shot Trayvon Martin8. </s> <s> What caused the cancellation of the opening day of the Republican National Convention?9. </s> <s> Who were the moderators of the first, second and third presidential debates?10. </s> <s> Who was the moderator of the vice-presidential debate?11. </s> <s> Who debated in @-@The Rumble in the Air-Conditioned Auditorium@-@?12. </s> <s> At a showing of which movie did James Eagan Holmes allegedly kill 12 people and wound 58 others?13. </s> <s> What is Alana Thompson better known as?14. </s> <s> How many Tour de France titles was Lance Armstrong stripped of?15. </s> <s> Which Ugandan warlord did Jason Russell expose, before allegedly exposing himself on the streets of San Diego?16. </s> <s> Which punk band are Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich members of?17. </s> <s> The Taliban shot Malala Yousafzai because of her advocacy of what cause?18. </s> <s> How did Lydia Callis prove a silver lining to the clouds of Hurricane Sandy?19. </s> <s> Who beat whom 4-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 to take his seventh such title, and where?20. </s> <s> Who is Ri Sol-ju@-@s husband?21. </s> <s> @-@P4@-@ quit after going @-@All In. </s> <s> @-@ Who is he?22. </s> <s> Which TV show did Angus T.

Hunt @-@ Bloomberg NewsWASHINGTON @-@ When it comes to presidential politics in Pennsylvania, Republicans are like the comic strip character Charlie Brown, who prepares to kick a football, only to have it pulled back every time by his pal Lucy. </s> <s> This time, it was Mitt Romney who was tempted to go for the prize, and his camp poured @-@10 million into Pennsylvania in the closing weeks of the U. S. presidential campaign. </s> <s> He lost by more than five points in that state, suffering the same fate as every one of his party@-@s nominees in the previous five presidential elections. </s> <s> To understand why, look at two suburban counties near Philadelphia: Delaware, a middle-class enclave, and Montgomery, a more affluent area. </s> <s> Republicans win many of the local offices in Montgomery and Delaware, and until a few decades ago, so did the party@-@s presidential nominees. </s> <s> This November, President Barack Obama carried both counties by about 60,000 votes. </s> <s> Montgomery is Pennsylvania@-@s third most populous county and Delaware its fifth; both are growing and becoming more diverse. </s> <s> The residents are not Mr. Romney@-@s 47 percent @-@ those he called takers who rely on government largess @-@ they just do not like the current brand of national Republicanism. </s> <s> Pennsylvania will remain relatively blue in presidential politics until Republicans can compete in these counties. </s> <s> This state of affairs is replicated in places that really were swing states, Virginia and Colorado for example. </s> <s> In Virginia, Prince William and Loudoun counties are Washington exurbs that Mr. Obama carried in 2008, that went for George W. Bush in 2004 and were won decisively by the Republican governor, Bob McDonnell, three years ago. </s> <s> Four days before the election this year, Mr. McDonnell predicted that Mr. Romney would win the counties. </s> <s> Instead, Mr. Obama carried Prince William, the third most populous county in the state, by 16 percent, or more than 28,000 votes. </s> <s> He won a narrower, but clear, victory in Loudoun, which before 2008 had not voted for a Democratic president since 1964 and where, 20 years earlier, George H. W. Bush won by a margin of more than two to one. </s> <s> These two counties, although different, share important political characteristics. </s> <s> They are fast-growing @-@ Prince William@-@s population has quadrupled over the past 40 years and Loudoun@-@s has grown tenfold @-@ affluent and diversifying with a mix of Latinos, blacks and Asians. </s> <s> In local races, they favor Republicans; the national patterns are going the other way. </s> <s> The picture is similar in Colorado, particularly in Arapahoe County, to the east of Denver, the state@-@s third most populous, and to the west, Jefferson County, which casts more votes than any other. </s> <s> Like their Virginia counterparts, these counties are fast-growing and comparatively well off. </s> <s> They shape close elections. </s> <s> Arapahoe is more diverse, with more minorities, and tilts more Democratic. </s> <s> Mr. Obama carried it on Nov. 6 by almost 10 points, more than a tilt. </s> <s> Jefferson is typical of large, growing suburbs with a range of voters from upper income to working class. </s> <s> @-@It mirrors in every election, Colorado,@-@ said Craig Hughes, an influential Democratic consultant there. </s> <s> @-@If you want to carry the state, you carry Jefferson. </s> <s> @-@ Mr. Obama won it by almost five points. </s> <s> It is also instructive, in a slightly different way, to look at a few big counties in Florida and Ohio, the mothers of all battleground states. </s> <s> In Florida, it is Hillsborough County, consisting of Tampa and its environs. </s> <s> It is the fourth most populous county in the state and the best bellwether: It has voted the same as the rest of the state in every presidential contest since John F. Kennedy won in 1960. </s> <s> Before 2008, Hillsborough had gone Republican in six of the seven preceding presidential elections. </s> <s> It went for Mr. Obama by about seven points four years ago and by a similar margin this year. </s> <s> @-@The Democrats@-@ grass-roots organization bringing minorities and young college students to vote was the difference,@-@ said Susan MacManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida. </s> <s> In Ohio, it was Hamilton County, which includes Cincinnati and suburbs. </s> <s> Ohio is a diverse state, and Hamilton County is a microcosm of that diversity: old-line Republicans, who used to dominate, plus young professionals and racial minorities. </s> <s> It was carried by George W. Bush in 2004 and Mr. Obama in 2008 and 2012. </s> <s> In no place was the ground game or infrastructure battle joined more forcefully, on both sides. </s> <s> Mr. Obama almost matched his 2008 margin, carrying the county by about 20,000 votes. </s> <s> In such a pitched battle, there are lots of explanations. </s> <s> Alex Triantafilou, the energetic Republican chairman for Hamilton County, worries that among the @-@independent swing voter, the 35- to 45-year-old female whose dad was a Republican,@-@ and among young professionals, @-@we just didn@-@t do as well as we should have. </s> <s> @-@ In 2012, Mr. Obama was a stronger candidate with a superior organization. </s> <s> Republicans are in dangerous disfavor with minorities and young voters. </s> <s> The party@-@s problems run deeper, as these eight bellwether counties across the United States illustrate. </s> <s> By Dirk JohnsonGENOA, Ill. @-@ Jim Harris expected vandalism, angry calls, maybe even a violent attack. </s> <s> Outside his old farmhouse, he had erected an upside-down American flag, a military signal of dire distress, and scrawled two big signs deploring President Obama@-@s re-election: @-@No Hope@-@ and @-@Enslaved by the 47 Percent. </s> <s> @-@He figured the display would incite some passers-by on his country road here in the cornfields of DeKalb County. </s> <s> This is scarcely a liberal bastion, but the county, which lies some 70 miles northwest of Chicago, cast a majority of votes for the fellow Illinoisan in the White House. </s> <s> @-@I seriously feel this country is in dire distress,@-@ said Mr. Harris, 55, an Air Force veteran who earns more than @-@40 an hour as a nonunion construction worker. </s> <s> @-@I can no longer trust the American people to do the right thing since they re-elected Obama. </s> <s> @-@These are deflated times for many ultraconservatives and Tea Party crusaders who felt certain that America had come to its senses and was going to make a sharp right turn at the polls in November. </s> <s> The sense of despair and anger since the election has been expressed in scattered cases around the country of people turning their American flags upside down. </s> <s> The display of upside-down flags as a protest strikes a raw chord with Terry Vance, a highly decorated and disabled Vietnam War veteran who serves as the adjutant quartermaster of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Illinois. </s> <s> @-@A lot of us fought and died for freedom of speech,@-@ Mr. Vance said. </s> <s> @-@But it seems to me there are more respectful ways to express your political opinions. </s> <s> Whether you like the president or not, he is the commander in chief of the United States of America. </s> <s> @-@In the view of some Tea Party advocates, the upside-down flag displays a

has changed far more than I expected. </s> <s> First, the people at the ideological extremes of the party have begun to self-ghettoize. </s> <s> The Tea Party movement attracted many people who are drawn to black and white certainties and lock-step unity. </s> <s> People like that have a tendency to migrate from mainstream politics, which is inevitably messy and impure, to ever more marginal oases of purity. </s> <s> Jim DeMint, for example, is leaving the Senate to go lead the Heritage Foundation. </s> <s> He is leaving the center of the action, where immigration, tax and other reforms will be crafted, for a political advocacy organization known more for ideological purity and fund-raising prowess than for creativity, curiosity or intellectual innovation. </s> <s> Second, politics is being reborn. </s> <s> For a time, Republican candidates like Richard Mourdock of Indiana proudly declared that they didn@-@t believe in compromise. </s> <s> Political activists spent more time purging deviationists than in trying to attract new converts. </s> <s> But that mania has passed. </s> <s> There are increasing signs that House Republicans are willing to unite behind Speaker John Boehner so he can cut a deal to avert the @-@fiscal cliff. </s> <s> @-@ There has been an epidemic of open-mindedness as Republicans try to win minority votes and create a version of their party that can be competitive in states like Connecticut and California. </s> <s> Finally, there has even been some shifting of economic values, or at least in how the party presents those values. </s> <s> The other speaker at the Kemp dinner was Representative Paul Ryan, who spoke about how to alleviate poverty. </s> <s> He didn@-@t abandon any of his fundamental beliefs, but he framed those beliefs in a more welcoming way and opened up room for growth and new thinking. </s> <s> The obligations to combat poverty, Ryan said, are beyond dispute. </s> <s> @-@The real debate is how best we can meet them. </s> <s> It@-@s whether they are better met by private groups or by government @-@ by voluntary action or by government action. </s> <s> The truth is, there has to be a balance. </s> <s> Government must act for the common good, while leaving private groups free to do the work that only they can do. </s> <s> @-@Like Rubio, Ryan projected a more balanced and attractive vision. </s> <s> He spoke with passion about those who long to rise. </s> <s> The Republicans may still blow it. </s> <s> If President Obama is flexible and they don@-@t meet him partway, Republicans would contribute to a

<s> Combined, these two categories of data allow a campaign to put together an online experience that will resonate with as many people as possible, but also to customize the experience so that you

remembering who you are and remembering what you like. </s> <s> In the offline world, which is my personal area of expertise, campaigns don@-@t know much more today than they did 44 years ago. </s> <s> In 1968, George Romney, then a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, made headlines for using a newfangled @-@secret weapon@-@ @-@ a voter file. </s> <s> As The Times explained

<s> I was born in 1976. </s> <s> Now we@-@re even. </s> <s> How do we predict whether people are going to vote or not? </s> <s> We look at the voter file. </s> <s> It tells us how often a person votes, although not for whom. </s> <s> Not all strategists agree about how to interpret this information, but the source of the data is no secret. </s> <s> What@-@s really new in politics today is not the data itself but how campaigns make sense of it. </s> <s> Cheaper and more plentiful computing power allows campaigns to process far more information than ever before to look for patterns, trends and correlations. </s> <s> The science of modeling is a modern-day application of a practice that has been around for nearly 200 years: polling. </s> <s> Pollsters ask voters whom they support for president and how strongly. </s> <s> Campaigns then take demographic information about these voters into account in order to make assumptions about the entire population of a given state. </s> <s> The mechanics are exactly the same for public polls and internal campaign analyses. </s> <s> The difference is that the campaigns use statistical techniques to apply these assumptions to individual records in the voter file rather than stopping short and simply assuming that entire sections of the electorate will behave identically. </s> <s> Contemporary data practice also frees campaigns from having to make assumptions about voters in the first place. </s> <s> In 2011 and 2012, the Obama campaign, with the help of more than two million volunteers, had more than 24 million conversations with voters. </s> <s> Online tools gave Obama supporters resources to help them play a crucial role in their neighborhoods, and a series of @-@share your story@-@ pages on the campaign Web site provided a venue for voters to communicate directly with the campaign in long form. </s> <s> All of this feedback doesn@-@t neatly boil down to a @-@yes@-@ or @-@no@-@ in a database @-@ and why should it? </s> <s> Numerous avenues of listening, combined with the digital capacity to hold on to qualitative feedback, make campaigns aware of the differences among voters@-@ motivations, attitudes, protestations @-@ not just their demographics and voting history. </s> <s> In a nation of over 200 million eligible voters, technology is allowing campaigns to finally see through the fog of the crowd and engage voters one by one. </s> <s> In other words, there is no giant blue computer sitting on the 101st floor of a sleek skyscraper, surrounded by bubbling tubes of illuminated liquid, spitting out the manifest destiny of America@-@s voters. </s> <s> Campaigns are moving away from the meaningless labels of pollsters and newsweeklies @-@ @-@Nascar dads@-@ and @-@waitress moms@-@ @-@ and moving toward treating each voter as a separate person. </s> <s> In 2012 you didn@-@t just have to be an African-American from Akron or a suburban married female age 45 to 54. </s> <s> More and more,

of the value of the individual to American politics. </s> <s> CAMBRIDGE, Mass. </s> <s> @-@ Mitt Romney and his team are not eager to dwell on regrets. </s> <s> But his campaign manager now says that

I. </s> <s> A. continue to press for greater latitude to carry out strikes; Justice Department and State Department officials, and the president@-@s counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, have argued for restraint, officials involved in the discussions say. </s> <s> More broadly, the administration@-@s legal reasoning has not persuaded many other countries that the strikes are acceptable under international law. </s> <s> For years before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the United States routinely condemned targeted killings of suspected terrorists by Israel, and most countries still object to such measures. </s> <s> But since the first targeted killing by the United States in 2002, two administrations have taken the position that the United States is at war with Al Qaeda and its allies and can legally defend itself by striking its enemies wherever they are found. </s> <s> Partly because United Nations officials know that the United States is setting a legal and ethical precedent for other countries developing armed drones, the U. N. plans to open a unit in Geneva early next year to investigate American drone strikes. </s> <s> The attempt to write a formal rule book for targeted killing began last summer after news reports on the drone program, started under President George W. Bush and expanded by Mr. Obama, revealed some details of the president@-@s role in the shifting procedures for compiling @-@kill lists@-@ and approving strikes. </s> <s> Though national security officials insist that the process is meticulous and lawful, the president and top aides believe it should be institutionalized, a course of action that seemed particularly urgent when it appeared that Mitt Romney might win the presidency. </s> <s> @-@There was concern that the levers might no longer be in our hands,@-@ said one official, speaking on condition of anonymity. </s> <s> With a continuing debate about the proper limits of drone strikes, Mr. Obama did not want to leave an @-@amorphous@-@ program to his successor, the official said. </s> <s> The effort, which would have been rushed to completion by January had Mr. Romney won, will now be finished at a more leisurely pace, the official said. </s> <s> Mr. Obama himself, in little-noticed remarks, has acknowledged that the legal governance of drone strikes is still a work in progress. </s> <s> @-@One of the things we@-@ve got to do is put a legal architecture in place, and we need Congressional help in order to do that, to make sure that not only am I reined in but any president@-@s reined in terms of some of the decisions that we@-@re making,@-@ Mr. Obama told Jon Stewart in an appearance on @-@The Daily Show@-@ on Oct. 18. </s> <s> In an interview with Mark Bowden for a new book on the killing of Osama bin Laden, @-@The Finish,@-@ Mr. Obama said that @-@creating a legal structure, processes, with oversight checks on how we use unmanned weapons, is going to be a challenge for me and my successors for some time to come. </s> <s> @-@ The president expressed wariness of the powerful temptation drones pose to policy makers. </s> <s> @-@There@-@s a remoteness to it that makes it tempting to think that somehow we can, without any mess on our hands, solve vexing security problems,@-@ he said. </s> <s> Despite public remarks by Mr. Obama and his aides on the legal basis for targeted killing, the program remains officially classified. </s> <s> In court, fighting lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and The New York Times seeking secret legal opinions on targeted killings, the government has refused even to acknowledge the existence of the drone program in Pakistan. </s> <s> But by many accounts, there has been a significant shift in the nature of the targets. </s> <s> In the early years, most strikes were aimed at ranking leaders of Al Qaeda thought to be plotting to attack the United States. </s> <s> That is the purpose Mr. Obama has emphasized, saying in a CNN interview in September that drones were used to prevent @-@an operational plot against the United States@-@ and counter @-@terrorist networks that target the United States. </s> <s> @-@But for at least two years in Pakistan, partly because of the C. I. </s> <s> A. </s> <s> @-@s success in decimating Al Qaeda@-@s top ranks, most strikes have been directed at militants whose main battle is with the Pakistani authorities or who fight with the Taliban against American troops in Afghanistan. </s> <s> In Yemen, some strikes apparently launched by the United States killed militants who were preparing to attack Yemeni military forces. </s> <s> Some of those killed were wearing suicide vests, according to Yemeni news reports. </s> <s> @-@Unless they were about to get on a flight to New York to conduct an attack, they were not an imminent threat to the United States,@-@ said Micah Zenko, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who is a critic of the strikes. </s> <s> @-@We don@-@t say that we@-@re the counterinsurgency air force of Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia, but we are. </s> <s> @-@Then there is the matter of strikes against people whose identities are unknown. </s> <s> In an online video chat in January, Mr. Obama spoke of the strikes in Pakistan as @-@a targeted, focused effort at people who are on a list of active terrorists. </s> <s> @-@ But for several years, first in Pakistan and later in Yemen, in addition to @-@personality strikes@-@ against named terrorists, the C. I. </s> <s> A. and the military have carried out @-@signature strikes@-@ against groups of suspected, unknown militants. </s> <s> Originally that term was used to suggest the specific @-@signature@-@ of a known high-level terrorist, such as his vehicle parked at a meeting place. </s> <s> But the word evolved to mean the @-@signature@-@ of militants in general @-@ for instance, young men toting arms in an area controlled by extremist groups. </s> <s> Such strikes have prompted the greatest conflict inside the Obama administration, with some officials questioning whether killing unidentified fighters is legally justified or worth the local backlash. </s> <s> Many people inside and outside the government have argued for far greater candor about all of the strikes, saying excessive secrecy has prevented public debate in Congress or a full explanation of their rationale. </s> <s> Experts say the strikes are deeply unpopular both in Pakistan and Yemen, in part because of allegations of large numbers of civilian casualties, which American officials say are exaggerated. </s> <s> Gregory D. Johnsen, author of @-@The Last Refuge: Yemen, Al Qaeda and America@-@s War in Arabia,@-@ argues that the strike strategy is backfiring in Yemen. </s> <s> @-@In Yemen, Al Qaeda is actually expanding,@-@ Mr. Johnsen said in a recent talk at the Brookings Institution, in part because of the backlash against the strikes. </s> <s> Shuja Nawaz, a Pakistan-born analyst now at the Atlantic Council in Washington, said the United States should start making public a detailed account of the results of each strike, including any collateral deaths, in part to counter propaganda from jihadist groups. </s> <s> @-@This is a grand opportunity for the Obama administration to take the drones out of the shadows and to be open about their objectives,@-@ he said. </s> <s> But the administration appears to be a long way from embracing such openness. </s> <s> The draft rule book for drone strikes that has been passed among agencies over the last several months is so highly classified, officials said, that it is hand-carried from office to office rather than sent by e-mail. </s> <s> Maureen DowdBy Maureen DowdWASHINGTONEveryone expected Hillary to lower the boom on Bibi Friday night. </s> <s> The bullying Israeli prime minister is fond of demanding that America set red lines on Iran@-@s nuclear ambitions. </s> <s> But he blithely stuck a finger in the eye of President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton Friday and went over a red line for successive American administrations: Israel gave the White House only a few hours@-@ notice that it was defying the U.

ThalerTHE biggest winners on Election Day weren@-@t politicians; they were numbers folks. </s> <s> Computer scientists, behavioral scientists, statisticians and everyone who works with data should be proud. </s> <s> They told us who was going to win, but they also helped to make many of those victories happen. </s> <s> Three groups of geeks deserve the love they rarely receive: people who run political polls, those who analyze the polls and those who figure out how to help campaigns connect with voters. </s> <s> Many people doubted the accuracy of political polling this year. </s> <s> Part of the skepticism was based on the wide range of predictions, with some showing President Obama in the lead, and others Mitt Romney. </s> <s> But there were additional, structural reasons to worry whether pollsters would be able to find representative samples of voters. </s> <s> One problem is that people are harder to reach on the telephone these days. </s> <s> About a third of voters no longer have a land line, and many of those who have them don@-@t pick up calls from strangers. </s> <s> So modern polling companies have to work harder to find voters willing to answer questions, then have to guess which of these respondents will actually show up and vote. </s> <s> So it may come as a surprise that, collectively, polling companies did quite well during this election season. </s> <s> Although there was a small tendency for the pollsters to overestimate Mr. Romney@-@s share of the vote, a simple average of the polls in swing states produced a very accurate prediction of the Electoral College outcome. </s> <s> Notably, the most accurate polls tended to be done via the Internet, many by companies new to this field. </s> <s> That@-@s geek victory No. </s> <s> 1. </s> <s> This relatively accurate polling data provided the raw material for the second group of election pioneers: poll analysts like Nate Silver, who writes the@-@ FiveThirtyEight blog for The New York Times, as well as Simon Jackman at Stanford, Sam Wang at Princeton and Drew Linzer at Emory University. </s> <s> What do poll analysts do? </s> <s> They are like the meteorologists who forecast hurricanes. </s> <s> Data for meteorologists comes from satellites and other tracking stations; data for the poll analysts comes from polling companies. </s> <s> The analysts@-@ job is to take the often conflicting data from the polls and explain what it all means. </s> <s> Worry about the reliability of the polling data led to widespread skepticism, or even outright hostility, toward poll analysts. </s> <s> The phrase @-@garbage in, garbage out@-@ was one of the more polite criticisms bouncing around the Internet in the days before the election. </s> <s> Because the polls were not, in fact, garbage, the first job of a poll analyst was quite easy: to average the results of the various polls, weighing more reliable and recent polls more heavily and correcting for known biases. </s> <s> @-@Some polls consistently project higher voter shares for one party or the other. </s> <s> @-@ A harder but more valuable task is to help readers translate the polling data into forecasts of the probability of victory. </s> <s> In Florida, where the final polls showed essentially a tie, according to Mr. Silver@-@s weighting method, it@-@s easy to see why he said the chance of either candidate winning the state was 50 percent. </s> <s> Ultimately, President Obama would very narrowly carry the state. </s> <s> But what about North Carolina, where Mr. Silver projected that Mitt Romney would get 50.6 percent of the vote and President Obama, 48.9 percent? </s> <s> Looking at that very small difference, what probability would you have assigned to a Romney victory in that state? </s> <s> Most people would guess something very close to 50-50. </s> <s> But not a good numbers guy. </s> <s> By looking back at previous elections with polling data this close, Mr. Silver estimated that Mr. Romney@-@s chances of winning North Carolina were 74 percent, a number that may seem surprisingly high. </s> <s> @-@Mr. Romney won the state. </s> <s> @-@The slightly larger but still seemingly tiny lead that the president held in Ohio, another swing state, led poll analysts to predict that the chance of an Obama victory in Ohio was around 90 percent. </s> <s> And because Mr. Romney would have to win several such states with small Obama leads in order to prevail in the Electoral College, the analysts ended up with similarly high degrees of confidence in an overall Obama victory. </s> <s> They ended up predicting the Electoral College outcome almost exactly right, especially if you consider the final outcome in Florida to be a virtual tie, as they had projected. </s> <s> Pundits making forecasts, some of whom had mocked the poll analysts, didn@-@t fare as well, and many failed miserably. </s> <s> George F. Will predicted that Mr. Romney would win 321 electoral votes, which turned out to be very close to President Obama@-@s actual total of 332. </s> <s> Jim Cramer from CNBC was nearly as wrong in the opposite direction, projecting that the president would win 440 electoral votes. </s> <s> There is a lesson here. </s> <s> When it comes to assessing the chances of some complicated combination of events, gut feelings are pretty much useless. </s> <s> Pundits are no better at forecasting election outcomes than they would be at predicting the final path of a hurricane. </s> <s> Smart pundits should consider either abandoning this activity, or consulting with the geeks before rendering their guesses. </s> <s> The third set of folks who deserve recognition in this election cycle were a group of young people working in a windowless room at Obama headquarters, affectionately known as the cave. </s> <s> They were part of the effort by the numbers-oriented campaign manager, Jim Messina, to maximize turnout. </s> <s> THERE are two basic parts of an election campaign. </s> <s> The first comes under the category of messaging @-@ deciding what a candidate should say and what ads to run. </s> <s> Most of the commentary we read about elections focuses on this component. </s> <s> The second part is turnout, and in some ways is even more important. </s> <s> Here is a simple bit of math that you don@-@t have to be a geek to understand: It doesn@-@t matter which candidate a person prefers unless that person shows up and votes. </s> <s> Pundits will debate for eternity which campaign did a better job of communicating its message, but there is no doubt which campaign won the turnout contest. </s> <s> Young, black and Hispanic voters all turned out in higher numbers than expected, and they often supported President Obama. </s> <s> Much was made of the big Obama advantage in field offices in swing states. </s> <s> But those field offices would have been little good to the campaign without modern tools to find potential voters, have them register and encourage them to vote. </s> <s> In the weeks leading up to the election, the Obama canvassers had accurate lists of potential voters and field-tested scripts for their contacts with voters. </s> <s> This explains in part why Democrats were such heavy users of early voting. </s> <s> By contrast, Project Orca, a get-out-the-vote computer program for the Romney campaign that wasn@-@t designed to be used until Election Day, reportedly had some bugs. </s> <s> There should be something reassuring about this Obama campaign efficiency to all Americans, even those who supported Mr. Romney based on his success in business. </s> <s> When it came to the business of running a campaign, it was the former professor and community organizer who had the more technologically savvy organization and made more effective use of its resources, including geek power. </s> <s> EditorialHouse Republicans like to talk about the need to find common ground with President Obama to make progress on important national issues, especially after the election. </s> <s> Yet within days, they were setting an agenda to eliminate an important element of his signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act. </s> <s> Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, recently proposed that House Republicans set their sights on repealing the part of the law that creates an independent board that is supposed to help limit growth in Medicare spending. </s> <s> Increases in Medicare spending have already slowed substantially, but the board will be needed to make sure that they stay low after 2014, when most of the law takes effect. </s> <s> The board, known as the Independent Payment Advisory Board, has been the subject of false attacks over the past few years by Republicans who claim that it will ration care, disrupt doctor-patient relationships, and tell patients what treatments they can receive. </s> <s> That is an outlandish way to describe a board that is prohibited by law from making any recommendations to ration care, raise premiums, increase cost-sharing, restrict benefits or limit eligibility. </s> <s> The board will consist of 12 experts, including doctors, patient advocates, employers and financial analysts, who will be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and three nonvoting government officials. </s> <s> Its sole duty is to monitor and, if necessary, reduce Medicare spending, which needs to be reined in to control deficits. </s> <s> If the projected growth rate in per capita Medicare spending exceeds specified targets pegged initially to an average of general and medical inflation and later to gross domestic product, the board must recommend

equivalent savings. </s> <s> The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that repealing the board might drive up federal spending on Medicare by @-@3.1 billion over a decade. </s> <s> Without pressure from such a board, Congress is apt to be weak in resisting demands by powerful health care groups and industries for higher Medicare reimbursements. </s> <s> Mr. Cantor apparently believes that throwing around the false charge that the board will harm patient care will persuade enough members of the Democrat-led Senate to follow the House, which has voted twice to repeal the board. </s> <s> In a recent letter to House Republicans, Mr. Cantor said that @-@one of our most successful critiques@-@ of the president@-@s health care reforms was that @-@Obamacare put the government between

OpinionBy Karen L. CoxCharlotte, N. C. IT@-@S tough being a Southern liberal. </s> <s> In the postelection analysis of the past two weeks, pundits have made hay of the fact that while Barack Obama won the election, Mitt Romney won the Confederacy. </s> <s> Or as Jon Stewart put it, @-@most of the Confederacy. </s> <s> @-@ After Mr. Romney carried the lion@-@s share of the region@-@s electoral votes, people were quick to pounce. </s> <s> One person on Twitter wrote, @-@I always knew the Zombie Apocalypse would start in the Southern States. </s> <s> @-@ On Facebook, in a widely shared image comparing the 2012 electoral map with the map of former slave states, the individual who posted it wrote, @-@Sometimes change is really hard, especially when people don@-@t want to change. </s> <s> @-@ That we are still using the term @-@Confederacy@-@ to describe the South and pointing to slave maps says a lot about how hard it is for the region to move beyond its historical reputation, however richly deserved, for one that reflects more current realities. </s> <s> Voters in Charlotte, N. C., Atlanta, Nashville, New Orleans, Birmingham, Ala., and even Jackson, Miss., gave Mr. Obama substantial majorities, not because they are out of step with the rest of the country but because they are part of the same urban-rural divide that drives voting everywhere. </s> <s> So if we@-@re going to apply the term @-@Confederacy,@-@ then perhaps we can all agree that while a majority of Southern white voters seem intransigent to change, the region is nevertheless being transformed by its changing demographics. </s> <s> Virginia, home to the capital of the Confederacy, went for Mr. Obama. </s> <s> Florida, part of the original Confederacy, also went for Mr. Obama. </s> <s> North Carolina, which Mr. Obama carried in 2008, went to Mr. Romney, but by a very slim margin @-@ more attributable to the economy and job losses than to any conspiracy of Confederate dunces. </s> <s> Many people have labeled my home state of North Carolina a red state, but it@-@s much more complicated than that. </s> <s> In the very rural mountain county of Avery, for example, Mr. Romney won with a whopping 74.5 percent of the vote, yet in Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, he lost to Mr. Obama by nearly 23 percentage points. </s> <s> @-@True, North Carolinians elected a Republican governor, but to be fair, the Democratic candidate ran a weak campaign. </s> <s> @-@Similarly, in Fulton County, Georgia, whose county seat is Atlanta, Mr. Obama bested Mr. Romney with about 64 percent of the vote but lost in the state@-@s mostly rural counties. </s> <s> If Charlotte or Atlanta were the size of New York City, then perhaps we wouldn@-@t tag either North Carolina or Georgia as red states. </s> <s> Even when you break down a clear blue state like New York, you can see this urban-rural dichotomy. </s> <s> In Brooklyn, Mr. Obama carried 81.4 percent of the vote; in the rural county of Hamilton, Mr. Romney won 62.2 percent. </s> <s> The same urban-rural divide can also be found in blue states like California and Washington. </s> <s> In other words, before our liberal allies in blue states point their fingers and scoff, they might want to take a look in their own rural backyards for evidence that their states actually have something in common with the supposedly backward ones in the South. </s> <s> Yes, Southern voters @-@especially white ones@-@ cast their lot with Mr. Romney. </s> <s> So, too, did voters in a large section of Western states. </s> <s> What do they have in common? </s> <s> They are states with largely rural populations that tend to be less diverse racially and ethnically, and they tend to vote more for conservative Republicans @-@ the same trend found in the rural counties of the bluest of states. </s> <s> THE coalition that voted for Mr. Obama nationally @-@ single women, minorities and young people @-@ is the same coalition that voted for the president in Southern states. </s> <s> Latino voters, for example, voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Obama, and they also represent the fastest-growing population within the South. </s> <s> Future elections will be determined by this expanding diversity in the region, much to the chagrin of conservative whites. </s> <s> It@-@s well known that the Democratic Party of old, commonly referred to as the @-@white man@-@s party,@-@ ruled the South. </s> <s> Today@-@s Southern Democrats reflect the changes that have taken place in the party@-@s platform in the post-World-War-II era. </s> <s> Old-school Southern Democrats, like Strom Thurmond, Jesse Helms and those who followed in their footsteps, bolted to the Republican Party, which adopted a @-@Southern strategy@-@ to win elections by appealing to whites@-@ racism. </s> <s> As we saw in this election, today@-@s Republican Party has become the bastion of white voters, and not just within the South. </s> <s> There is evidence that @-@whiteness@-@ is not a foolproof strategy in the region, given its changing demography. </s> <s> While it is true that Republicans dominate the region, there is change in the air. </s> <s> I can see this in my own family. </s> <s> Every summer my brother, who is decidedly Republican, plants a garden in which he grows a variety of peppers @-@ jalape@-@os, habaneros and poblanos. </s> <s> He is proud of his garden and shares his harvest with friends who own a Mexican restaurant near his home in Greensboro, N. C. I doubt that his conversations with the people who work there center on whether they are in this country legally or illegally. </s> <s> So while he may remain a Republican, I believe he recognizes the contributions of Latinos to his community and knows that they do not threaten his success as a white man. </s> <s> Liberals north and west of me @-@ people who consider themselves educated and learned @-@ are the very ones who seem to make the most ill-informed statements @-@often in a bad attempt at humor@-@ about the region@-@s politics. </s> <s> As someone I follow on Twitter posted: @-@I@-@m liberal. </s> <s> I live in the South. </s> <s> Your jokes are not funny. </s> <s> @-@ I have no idea to what he was responding, but I can sympathize. </s> <s> To my chagrin, liberals living outside the South deny our existence, lump us all together by using rhetoric about the Confederacy and heap pity on us with a little condescension thrown in for good measure. </s> <s> They also seem to be unaware of nuance. </s> <s> The fact is, liberals everywhere live among people who don@-@t share their views. </s> <s> Are you listening Wisconsin, Arizona, Indiana and, yes, New York? </s> <s> Jesse

earliest days, analysts focused on historic economic and political metrics to explain the steep uphill climb Mr. Obama faced in his re-election bid: no sitting president had been re-elected with unemployment higher than 7.2 percent; or the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index below 78 percent; or the @-@right track@-@ rating for the country as low as it was. </s> <s> Such conventional indicators

the crisis were @-@too severe for anyone to fix in a single term,@-@ while only 4 in 10 voters believed another president would have been able to do more than Mr. Obama to get the economy moving in the past four years. </s> <s> President Obama offered Americans a clear, forward-looking vision that focused on creating a stronger, more secure future for average Americans and their children, built on investments we need as a nation and a balanced approach to fiscal issues such as taxes and deficit reduction. </s> <s> Spending cuts alone could not address voter concerns @-@ @-@89 percent of

and from the context within which they viewed the economy. </s> <s> The president@-@s forward-looking approach resonated strongly with American voters, who by a margin of 77 percent to 17 percent said that which candidate would make their life better four years from now was more important to their vote than whether they were better off four years ago. </s> <s> And voters simply didn@-@t believe

their part to help the community or people in need. </s> <s> @-@Moreover, Mr. Obama@-@s strength on the economy was not about @-@empathy,@-@ as many experts asserted. </s> <s> Rather, for average working-class and middle-class Americans who have believed for nearly a decade that the economic system in America had fallen out of balance for people like them, the president@-@s personal story and policies engendered trust because they connected with voters@-@ lives, aspirations, and beliefs about what it would take to create the future they wanted. </s> <s> That trust was the central economic test in this election. </s> <s> That is why, despite the credit given to Mr. Romney for @-@understanding@-@ the economy @-@ a phrasing that spoke to a technical understanding @-@ Mr. Obama was always significantly more trusted on qualities that matter to working Americans. </s> <s> In fact, independent voters in our survey, by 54 to 40, said it was more important for a president to have @-@the willingness to fight for middle-class families@-@ rather than a @-@technical understanding of the economy. </s> <s> @-@And when asked what the key to growing our economy was, nearly two in three

And why did it receive so little attention during the presidential campaign? </s> <s> Well, it@-@s complicated @-@ the so-called cliff, that is. </s> <s> And most solutions are politically painful. </s> <s> In a rare show of bipartisanship, or mutual protection, both parties ducked the debate until after the election. </s> <s> What follows is an attempt to demystify the issue, which President Obama and the lame-duck Congress now are struggling over, and which may occupy them right through the holidays. </s> <s> Q. </s> <s> What is the fiscal cliff?A. </s> <s> The term refers to more than @-@500 billion in tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts scheduled to take effect after Jan. 1 @-@ for fiscal year 2013 alone @-@ unless Mr. Obama and Republicans reach an alternative deficit-reduction deal. </s> <s> Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who is not known for catchy phrases, coined the metaphor @-@fiscal cliff@-@ last winter to warn of the dangerous yet avoidable drop-off ahead in the nation@-@s fiscal path. </s> <s> It stuck. </s> <s> Q. </s> <s> If we go over this so-called cliff, what happens? </s> <s> A. </s> <s> Taxes would rise for nearly every taxpayer and many businesses. </s> <s> Financing for most federal programs, military and domestic, would be cut. </s> <s> Many economists say that while annual budget deficits are too high, these new taxes and spending cuts would be too much deficit reduction, too suddenly, for a weak economy. </s> <s> More than @-@500 billion equals roughly 3 percent to 4 percent of gross domestic product. </s> <s> The Congressional Budget Office has said the result would be a short recession, though some analysts say the measures could be managed so they do less damage. </s> <s> @-@Slope,@-@ they argue, is a better metaphor than cliff. </s> <s> Q. </s> <s> Exactly what tax increases are in store?A. </s> <s> When a tax cut expires, the practical effect is a tax increase. </s> <s> And a slew of tax cuts @-@ @-@400 billion for 2013 @-@ expire on Dec. 31: All of the Bush-era rate reductions; smaller tax cuts that periodically expire for businesses and individuals; and the 2-percentage-point cut in payroll taxes that Mr. Obama pushed in 2010, which increased an average worker@-@s take-home pay by about @-@1,000 a year. </s> <s> Also, 28 million taxpayers @-@ about one in five, all middle- to upper-income @-@ would have to pay the alternative minimum tax in 2012, raising their taxes more. </s> <s> That is because Congress has failed to pass an inflation adjustment, as it usually does, to restrict the number of taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum largely to the affluent. </s> <s> Q. </s> <s> What spending would be cut? </s> <s> A. </s> <s> An emergency unemployment-compensation program is expiring, which would save @-@26 billion but end payments to millions of Americans who remain jobless and have exhausted state benefits. </s> <s> Medicare payments to doctors would be reduced 27 percent, or @-@11 billion, because this year Congress has not passed the usual so-called @-@doc fix@-@ to block the cuts, which otherwise are required by a 1990s cost-control law. </s> <s> The biggest cut would be @-@65 billion, enacted across the board for most federal programs over the last nine months of fiscal year 2013, from January through September. </s> <s> This cut, known as the sequester, was mandated by an August 2011 budget deal between Mr. Obama and Congress that ended their standoff over raising the nation@-@s debt limit. </s> <s> In that deal, they agreed to reduce spending by @-@1 trillion over 10 years and to identify an additional @-@1.2 trillion in savings by January 2013. </s> <s> If they fail to agree on the second installment @-@ as is the case so far @-@ the automatic cuts will kick in. </s> <s> Q. </s> <s> Why did the parties create such a fiscal and economic threat? </s> <s> A. </s> <s> It was part intentional, part coincidental. </s> <s> The intentional: Since Ronald Reagan@-@s administration, with mixed results, presidents and Congresses have occasionally mandated a self-imposed future crisis to force themselves to agree on unpopular tax and spending actions. </s> <s> In that spirit, the idea behind the August 2011 deal was that Republicans would so greatly fear the military cuts, and Democrats the domestic spending cuts, that they would negotiate a deficit-reduction alternative by the Jan. 1 deadline. </s> <s> The coincidental: The measures from the 2011 deal are set to take effect at the same time as the changes to jobless benefits, the alternative minimum tax adjustment and the Medicare @-@doc fix,@-@ and the expiration of the Bush tax cuts @-@ a confluence that the two parties did not fully expect back in August 2011. </s> <s> The nation will also reach its debt ceiling in January, creating additional uncertainty. </s> <s> Accounting maneuvers by the Treasury Department could push that deadline to March, but Mr. Obama wants a debt-limit increase as part of any deal, adding another item to the agenda. </s> <s> Q. </s> <s> Can@-@t Democrats and Republicans agree on anything here? </s> <s> A. </s> <s> They actually agree on a lot. </s> <s> Neither side favors the sequester, an expanded alternative minimum tax or Medicare cuts for doctors; the issue in preventing those outcomes is where to find offsetting savings to avoid adding to annual deficits. </s> <s> And both parties want to extend all of the Bush tax cuts for 98 percent of taxpayers @-@ on income below @-@250,000 for couples and on income below @-@200,000 for individuals. </s> <s> Their main disagreement is a familiar one: the Bush rates on income above that, for the top 2 percent of taxpayers. </s> <s> Mr. Obama campaigned against the rates in 2008 and in 2012. </s> <s> In December 2010, when the Bush tax cuts originally were to expire, Mr. Obama reluctantly agreed to extend all of them for two years in exchange for Republicans@-@ support for the temporary payroll tax cut and extended jobless aid. </s> <s> This time, he swears, is different. </s> <s> Q. </s> <s> If the president extended all the Bush rates once, why wouldn@-@t he do so again for the right concessions? </s> <s> A. </s> <s> The economy was weaker in 2010, and so was Mr. Obama. </s> <s> Republicans had just triumphed in the midterm elections, taking control of the House. </s> <s> Now Mr. Obama is fresh off re-election, and Congressional Democrats have gained seats. </s> <s> He vows that he will not allow the top tax rate to stay at 35 percent; a return to 39.6 percent would raise about @-@1 trillion over 10 years. </s> <s> Chastened Republicans have suggested they would support higher revenues, but only from limiting tax deductions for high-income taxpayers, not from higher rates. </s> <s> Mr. Obama has not ruled out a compromise that would limit deductions as well as setting the top rate above 35 percent but below 39.6 percent. </s> <s> Q. </s> <s> What now? </s> <s> Might they really reach an impasse?A. </s> <s> No one knows. </s> <s> Despite market jitters about that outcome, Democrats suggest that they are willing to let Jan. 1 come and go without resolution unless Republicans relent on the top rate. </s> <s> That could simply be bravado, to make Republicans blink. </s> <s> A Washington Post-Pew Research Center poll this week found that a majority of Americans would blame Republicans for failure. </s> <s> Q. </s> <s> Is there a best-case outcome here?A. </s> <s> Many budget experts and economists are hoping for a two-part deal. </s> <s> The first part would extend many of the tax cuts and repeal the automatic spending cuts to avert the changes scheduled after Jan. 1. </s> <s> But it would be contingent on the second part: a framework for reducing projected long-term deficits by overhauling both the tax code @-@ to raise revenues @-@ and entitlement programs @-@ chiefly Medicare and Medicaid, whose rising costs in an aging population are unsustainable. </s> <s> Those overhauls would preoccupy Mr. Obama and Congress through 2013 and perhaps 2014. </s> <s> Such an agreement would set specific targets for new tax revenue and spending cuts to reduce deficits by about @-@4 trillion over a decade, giving Congress and the president more time to work out the details. </s> <s> If they failed to do so, presumably other automatic changes might be in store as an enforcement action @-@ setting up yet another looming deadline. </s> <s> DOES the re-election of the first black president mean the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is unnecessary and perhaps unconstitutional? </s> <s>

</s> <s> Gov. </s> <s> Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican who had been one of its toughest critics, signaled this week that he would be open to compromising. </s> <s> @-@The election is over, and

exchange. </s> <s> @-@So to ask states to get involved is like asking states to run the post office. </s> <s> It doesn@-@t make sense. </s> <s> @-@Setting up an insurance exchange is no simple task. </s> <s> Among other things, states have to set up a governance board, decide what kinds of health plans to offer through the exchange and build sophisticated information technology systems. </s> <s> Although many Republican governors delayed planning, some have quietly prepared. </s> <s> Gov. </s> <s> Brian Sandoval of Nevada and Gov. </s> <s> Susana Martinez of New Mexico have spent months laying the groundwork for exchanges; so has Mike Chaney, the Mississippi insurance commissioner. </s> <s> Creating a state-based exchange will @-@allow us to retain some flexibility,@-@ said Matt

most Republican-led states are somewhere in the middle @-@ still vexing over whether to build an exchange on their own, do it in partnership with the federal government or let the federal government

clash over the best course for reviving their party@-@s fortunes. </s> <s> Like Mr. From@-@s Democrats after the 1988 White House race, Republicans have lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections. </s> <s> In much the same fashion as Ms. Goodwin describes their political ancestors, Republicans are grappling with how to respond to a changing country without angering an old-guard base and rupturing the party. </s> <s> Both moments offer an instructive lesson to Republicans as they enter a midterm election year: As painful as it may be, it is better to have your differences out now than during the next presidential election. </s> <s> @-@My old mentor Gillis Long told me that if you are not willing to spill blood between elections, you@-@ll spill in it on

one in 1912. </s> <s> Up to that point, Republicans had lost only two presidential campaigns, going back to the Civil War. </s> <s> But after fulfilling a pledge to not run in 1908 for what would have effectively been a third term, Roosevelt ceded the nomination to Taft and with it a fragile hold on the party@-@s two main wings: the upstart progressives and the party@-@s traditional laissez-faire wing. </s> <s> The division between the two groups grew wider and finally became irreparable in 1912, when Roosevelt challenged his old friend and the sitting president for the nomination. </s> <s> Ms. Goodwin posits that had he run for re-election in 1908, Roosevelt could have kept the party together and moved it further toward progressivism. </s> <s> @-@There is no doubt that if Teddy would have run again in 1908 he would have won,@-@ said Ms. Goodwin, noting that @-@in 1910 many progressive Republicans won, especially in the West. </s> <s> @-@The combination, she argued, of Roosevelt@-@s forceful personality along with the generational turnover taking place in the party, where older conservatives were being replaced with progressives, may have been enough for Republicans to have reoriented themselves and averted the agony of 1912. </s> <s> Instead, by choosing to challenge Taft, Roosevelt himself initiated what he called @-@the biggest fight the Republican Party has been in since the Civil War. </s> <s> @-@Roosevelt called Taft @-@a fathead@-@ and said he possessed @-@the brains of a guinea pig. </s> <s> @-@ The incumbent was equally tough, suggesting that

within his party. </s> <s> To many in the conservative movement, Mr. Christie represents the kind of candidate the Republican establishment has foisted on the base in recent presidential elections @-@

negative view, among conservatives, 33 percent view him favorably and 25 percent have an unfavorable impression. </s> <s> Those around Mr. Christie are aware of the unease among conservatives and are beginning to emphasize his positions on issues like abortion @-@ he is opposed to it, except in cases of rape, incest and the life of the mother @-@ and state spending to try to blunt those concerns. </s> <s> The governor@-@s standing among conservatives is important because Iowa and South Carolina, two of the first three states in the Republican presidential nominating contest, are dominated by ideology-driven activists. </s> <s> In addition, grass-roots activists are providing much of the passion and energy for the Republican party right now. </s> <s> In an interview last week, Mr. Christie

benefits. </s> <s> Believe me, if Washington were able to do that, they@-@d have a parade for them. </s> <s> My record is my record. </s> <s> I@-@m proud of it. </s> <s> And it is a conservative record, governing as a conservative in a blue state. </s> <s> @-@But Mr. Christie@-@s record can be read a number of ways. </s> <s> Some conservatives have already raised questions about his actions on gun control: He vetoed several bills last summer, including one that would ban the .50-caliber Barrett rifle, but has approved others, such as a measure that requires the police to provide the state with more information about guns used in crimes. </s> <s> And while he has made known his opposition to same-sex marriage, he abandoned an appeal of a court decision that legalized it in his state. </s> <s> During his re-election campaign, he also suggested he may support providing in-state tuition to illegal immigrants. </s> <s> With a civil war underway inside the Republican Party, what conservatives fear most is that Mr. Christie@-@s nomination would effectively mean that the party establishment had won the internal struggle @-@ and that Mr. Christie@-@s force of personality trumped ideas. </s> <s> Asked in an interview whether Mr. Christie could unite the party@-@s factions, Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, responded flatly: @-@No. </s> <s> I don@-@t think Chris Christie has any interest in bridging that divide because he@-@ll run as an aggressive, Northeastern moderate who can get something done. </s> <s> I don@-@t see him using conservative language. </s> <s> He might be able to get nominated, but it will be running as a personality leader, not a movement leader. </s> <s> @-@To an influential bloc of the Republican establishment, of course, Mr. Christie is nothing short of a savior @-@ a charismatic governor with not a whiff of Washington on him, with a proven ability to get votes from the constituencies that have proved resistant to the Republican Party in recent elections, like women and Hispanics. </s> <s> The excitement is especially noticeable among many party operatives, contributors and insiders, who see Mr. Christie as perhaps their only

Adams, a student at Yale, will open the event, signaling that the Clinton world intends to bring in fresh voices, even if it means edging some loyal aides out. </s> <s> The event signals a turning point for Ready for Hillary. </s> <s> The group, registered just before Mrs. Clinton left the State Department in February by young staff members who worked in junior roles on her 2008 campaign, was largely viewed as a makeshift organization that sold Hillary Clinton buttons and iPhone cases online. </s> <s> Some longtime supporters had worried that the group emerged too soon and that if it were not well run, it could hurt Mrs. Clinton@-@s prospects, even though she is not involved or in contact with its organizers. </s> <s> But veteran aides like Mr. Smith, Ms. Sefl and Harold Ickes, a former deputy chief of staff in the Clinton White House, are now signed on as advisers. </s> <s> In recent months, the group has held events in several cities from San Francisco to Houston and has become among the dominant @-@ if not best financed @-@ political action committees on the Democratic side. </s> <s> The sessions in New York will point to several advantages favoring a Democrat in 2016. </s> <s> @-@Democrats do have a series of advantages baked into the cake in terms of demographics and the electoral map,@-@ said Geoff Garin, a pollster who succeeded Mark Penn as chief strategist for Mrs. Clinton@-@s 2008 campaign. </s> <s> Fresh off working on behalf of Terry McAuliffe in his successful campaign for governor of Virginia, Mr. Garin will talk about reaching the growing numbers of Hispanics and college-educated white women, and the decline in non-college-educated white male voters, one of the most challenging demographics for Mrs. Clinton. </s> <s> But, he added that some very big odds will work against any Democratic presidential nominee in 2016. </s> <s> @-@Since World War II, the only time the same party won a third term in the White House was 1988,@-@ Mr. Garin said. </s> <s> Supporters are also well aware of the attacks Mrs. Clinton would face. </s> <s> During a lunch session, David Brock, founder of Media Matters for America, will lead the @-@Ready for the Right Wing@-@ tutorial on how to combat conservative attacks and misinformation in the media. </s> <s> The future of Ready for Hillary is unclear. </s> <s> Should Mrs. Clinton run, the group would most likely dissolve, after encouraging those on its email list to transfer their support to the official Clinton campaign. </s> <s> The widespread belief is that several Ready for Hillary staff members would take up positions on the campaign, which has made the group somewhat of a way station for hopeful aides. </s> <s> If Mrs. Clinton does not run, the group would likely throw its support behind whoever becomes the Democratic nominee. </s> <s> Either way, this type of early unity and strategizing around a single candidate is a good thing and a rarity in Democratic politics, said Ronald Feldman, a Ready for Hillary national finance council co-chairman who supported John Edwards in 2008. </s> <s> @-@We@-@ve never been paying this much attention this early on, but

presented himself as a moderate, mainstream, business Republican @-@ and wasn@-@t lying now, when he presented himself as a bona fide red-meat conservative. </s> <s> Halperin and Heilemann tell it pretty straight. </s> <s> You cannot guess, from reading the book, whom they voted for. </s> <s> But you can sense their devotion to a higher creed, that of the political journalist. </s> <s> Two provisions of that creed stand out in particular. </s> <s> First, no detail is too trivial to report. </s> <s> Blame Politico, the newspaper about politics and its accompanying Web site @-@for which I used to work@-@, for this. </s> <s> It has built an empire on the droppings of less-successful publications. </s> <s> Item 2 in the creed is respect for professionalism, however it manifests itself. </s> <s> Political advisers ought to know when and how to lie, cheat and steal for their candidates. </s> <s> That@-@s their job, and they should do it well. </s> <s> It is the journalist@-@s job to expose them if she can. </s> <s> And if we all do our jobs well, we don@-@t need to worry about things like, well, lying, cheating and stealing. </s> <s> For example, an unmistakable cloud of contempt hangs over the authors@-@ telling of an idea that Joe Biden had during the campaign. </s> <s> Why not, said Biden, send millions of households a pamphlet about where the president stood on the issues of controversy in the campaign? </s> <s> @-@Yes, a pamphlet,@-@ they write witheringly. </s> <s> @-@Yes, millions@-@ of copies. </s> <s> But what is so obviously stupid about this idea, except that it is not the kind of thing you pay the pros to come up with?Politics is a macho, macho world as Halperin and Heilemann portray it. </s> <s> The @-@Romneyites convened a series of @-@Kill Newt@-@ meetings. </s> <s> @-@ @-@Mitt was perfectly happy to strafe the speaker until he was a human colander. </s> <s> @-@ Romney is not unique @-@ though his particular violent patois comes from the world

be as the final @-@let@-@s hope@-@ flowering of the art of umbrage. </s> <s> Umbrage was the engine of the campaign. </s> <s> It was what kept things moving along. </s> <s> Typically an umbrage episode began when someone would say something he or she shouldn@-@t have. </s> <s> This may be because it@-@s not true. </s> <s> More often, it@-@s all too true. </s> <s> Remember this one from Gov. </s> <s> Rick Perry of Texas? </s> <s> @-@If you say that we should not educate children who have come into our state for no other reason than they@-@ve been brought there by no fault of their own, I don@-@t think you have a heart. </s> <s> @-@ I thought this was the sweetest thing I@-@d ever heard Rick Perry say. </s> <s> But Halperin and Heilemann make clear it was a terrible mistake, because it suggested that anyone who disagreed with him on how to treat people who were brought to the United States as young children, and had no other home country to go to, was heartless. </s> <s> @-@Romney@-@s position was that if you make it unpleasant enough for them to stay, people will @-@self-deport. </s> <s> @-@ How dare you call him heartless! </s> <s> @-@Mitt Romney @-@pounded away at the Texan on the issue for a solid month. </s> <s> @-@ Halperin and Heilemann call it @-@an act of political suicide, . </s> <s> . </s> <s> . </s> <s> verbal seppuku. </s> <s> @-@ Newt Gingrich committed a similar gaffe, calling for a @-@humane@-@ immigration policy, and taking a similar pounding from Romney for that. </s> <s> The authors lend a sympathetic ear to Karl Rove, the Republican Rasputin, as he describes his disgust at hearing that Newt Gingrich took a few hours off one Saturday morning in Chicago to go see the dinosaurs at the Field Museum. </s> <s> Can you spot the gaffe? </s> <s> It@-@s not Rove dissing Gingrich for going to a museum. </s> <s> The gaffe is Gingrich taking time off from politics to go to a museum. </s> <s> Shame on him! </s> <s> As the authors put it, he @-@frittered away@-@ valuable time. </s> <s> To me, it@-@s one of the best things I@-@ve ever heard about Newt. </s> <s> God forbid he should take a Saturday off and go to a museum. </s> <s> God forbid someone running for president should have any interest except politics. </s> <s> Gingrich@-@s wife, Callista, did not want him to run. </s> <s> In one of their few moments of discretion, Halperin and Heilemann write intriguingly that Gingrich @-@wheedled Callista into acquiescence, promising that he would accommodate her priorities. </s> <s> @-@ It sounds suspiciously like a euphemism. </s> <s> Has poor Newt been accommodating her priorities ever since?Romney was ruthless about exploiting gaffes by others, but he also was the biggest victim of the umbrage wars. </s> <s> He said he wasn@-@t concerned about the poor. </s> <s> He also said he didn@-@t care about the rich. </s> <s> In context, he was sucking up to the middle class and got entangled. </s> <s> But he didn@-@t mean to say what he was taken to have said. </s> <s> The most significant gaffe of the campaign was by a Democratic operative named Hilary Rosen, who told CNN that Ann Romney, Mitt@-@s wife, @-@never worked a day in her life. </s> <s> @-@ This was immediately recognized by all sides as a big mistake, and Romney@-@s team lost no time in saying how appalled and hurt they were. </s> <s> @-@Ann Romney had raised five boys, as she lost no time in pointing out. </s> <s> No one was tempted to take the position that raising five boys was not work. </s> <s> @-@But in fact, the Romneys and their camp were not appalled and not hurt by this remark. </s> <s> They were delighted. </s> <s> Halperin and Heilemann describe Ann Romney telling a campaign aide, apparently right after she heard about it: That@-@s offensive to me. </s> <s> And boy, it@-@s stupid politically. </s> <s> We can really go after them on that. </s> <s> Later, forgetting that she was supposed to be deeply offended, Ann Romney was overheard calling Rosen@-@s gaffe @-@an early birthday present. </s> <s> @-@The whole umbrage routine is now an established political chess move. </s> <s> Politicians and their advisers pray that the other guy will say something offensive, or something that can be characterized or misinterpreted as offensive. </s> <s> Then they take mock offense. </s> <s> Gotcha! </s> <s> Yet by its nature a gaffe is something the speaker didn@-@t mean to say. </s> <s> It may reflect his or her true belief or it may not. </s> <s> But if it was said unintentionally, there@-@s no logical reason the speaker should be held to it. </s> <s> Yet the gaffe@-@umbrage two-step is now the basic move in our politics. </s> <s> It@-@s ridiculous. </s> <s> This isn@-@t a game. </s> <s> One subject that gets

</s> <s> The effort, designed to preserve Democrats@-@ dominance of the State Legislature and complicate Mr. Christie@-@s plans to build a record of legislative achievement as he considers a

state@-@s election law enforcement board, outside spending for candidates had topped @-@35 million, twice the amount spent when Mr. Christie, a Republican, was elected in 2009 and the highest recorded by any state except California. </s> <s> The surge of spending is likely to be replicated around the country next year, as outside groups from both parties signal increasing interest in influencing

independent expenditures. </s> <s> Last month, a federal appeals court lifted New York@-@s limit on contributions to state-level @-@super PACs,@-@ following a lawsuit by a prominent Republican donor. </s> <s> But in New Jersey, a similar legal challenge was led by a Democratic group called the Fund for Jobs, Growth and Security, which won a federal lawsuit in July to overturn state limits on checks to independent groups. </s> <s> The group, run by veterans of the Democrats@-@ successful super PACs from the 2012 election, has since raised millions of dollars, much of it from New Jersey teachers@-@ and carpenters@-@ unions. </s> <s> They have also been aided by George Norcross III, a South Jersey Democratic power broker who has maintained an informal alliance with Mr. Christie in recent years but who also has close ties to the State Senate leader, Stephen M. Sweeney, a Gloucester County Democrat. </s> <s> With their party@-@s candidate for governor, Barbara Buono, trailing far behind in polls of the election on Tuesday, Democrats fear a Christie landslide would tilt enough seats to strengthen his influence in the Legislature. </s> <s> Democrats have held both houses of the Legislature for more than a decade, with a 24-to-16 majority in the Senate and a 48-to-32 majority in the Assembly. </s> <s> But because several Democratic senators routinely vote with the governor, party leaders are concerned that a shift of just a few seats could give him a governing majority in the upper chamber. </s> <s> The Fund for Jobs, Growth and Security, along with an affiliated nonprofit group, the General Growth Fund, have poured @-@8 million into nine legislative districts where Republicans are trying to capitalize on Mr. Christie@-@s expected coattails. </s> <s> By contrast, in 2011, independent spending on legislative races totaled just @-@1.8 million. </s> <s> In the First Legislative District, which covers the southernmost reaches of the Jersey Shore, the fund has spent @-@1.7 million trying to bolster a Democratic assemblyman, Nelson T.

written narrative of the Obama campaign. </s> <s> Wolffe, who is the executive editor at msnbc.com, reports that in their effort to win, Obama@-@s people became everything they purported to disdain. </s> <s> They obsessed over winning the daily news cycle. </s> <s> They reveled in biting negative ads, battering Mitt Romney@-@s business career to persuade swing voters that they were better off sticking with Obama. </s> <s> After sneering at Clintonesque microtargeting, they pioneered nanotargeting, producing hundreds of different ads to reach infinitesimal slices of the electorate. </s> <s> Postelection, many of the Obama data experts started consultancies, renting the campaign@-@s innovative analytic techniques, developed with money from millions of grass-roots donors, to private clients. </s> <s> Hope and change now sell soap flakes. </s> <s> Mixed in with this narrative, and apparently designed to create the kind of buzz that sells campaign books, is the second one, consisting of inside anecdotes about infighting. </s> <s> The @-@No Drama Obama@-@ team, in Wolffe@-@s telling, was a myth. </s> <s> Obama@-@s top aides fought with one another over turf, television appearances and lines of command. </s> <s> David Axelrod was eased out after sending a lawyer to negotiate his cut of the ad spending. </s> <s> Stephanie Cutter, a high-ranking adviser, is cast as prickly and arrogant. </s> <s> Readers may find her alleged paranoia justified after learning how a group of other senior aides, all men, gathered at a baseball game to plot how to demote her. </s> <s> Yet @-@The Message@-@ is actually most interesting when Wolffe descends from the executive suite to the @-@boiler room,@-@ where Obama@-@s data gurus and his advertising chief, Jim Margolis, constructed the campaign@-@s digital political machine. </s> <s> By merging polling, responses collected by field volunteers and commercial data, they could make fine-grained predictions about individual voters@-@ likelihood of choosing Obama, together with what television shows they watched. </s> <s> The information allowed Obama@-@s team to hunt efficiently for bargain advertising rates. </s> <s> @-@Many undecided voters, it turned out, watched the Syfy channel at 3 in the morning. </s> <s> @-@ That precision upended one of the great assumptions about 2012: despite being outspent, Obama and his allies actually got more advertisements on the air in many critical markets than their opponents did. </s> <s> Still, it@-@s no easy thing to squeeze drama out of the grinding trench warfare of 2012. </s> <s> Much of the action in @-@The Message@-@ takes place hundreds of miles from the campaign trail, in conference suites and hotel rooms. </s> <s> Wolffe@-@s narrative of tension and ineptitude sometimes feels strained, perhaps because we know Obama won handily in the end. </s> <s> There are long stretches consisting of interviews with advisers like Axelrod and David Plouffe, explaining how the Obama campaign reacted to this focus group or that Romney misstep. </s> <s> In a sign of the flooded market for campaign books, one of Wolffe@-@s juicier anecdotes, where an angry

Brown, the former Republican senator from Massachusetts who is considering a Senate run in New Hampshire, which holds the first presidential primary. </s> <s> Already, Mr. Christie is assembling the kind of national fund-raising network that would be essential to a presidential campaign; some 35 percent of the @-@9 million he has raised for his re-election is from out of state, and he has held fund-raisers around the country, both in donor-rich enclaves like Palm Beach, Fla., and McLean, Va., and in Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, Chicago and throughout California. </s> <s> Thanks to his prominence, and the fact that New Jersey is one of only two states with contests for governor this year, Mr. Christie has been able to cultivate big donors around the country. </s> <s> @-@Under the guise of his re-election, he@-@s able to meet these folks and say, @-@I need your help,@-@ Mr. Rove said. </s> <s> The governor has tapped some boldface contributors like the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. </s> <s> But more important for his future ambitions are the checks he has gathered from loyal Republican givers like Mr. Simmons, the deep-pocketed Dallas political patron, and lesser-known local power players like Dax R. Swatek, an Alabama lobbyist. </s> <s> @-@I wrote him a check because, first, I think, as a Republican in New Jersey doing what he@-@s been able to do is pretty damn impressive,@-@ said Mr. Swatek, who is close to many of his state@-@s leading Republicans. </s> <s> @-@Secondly, looking at it long-term, the way the presidential map is, it is going to be very difficult for Republicans to win without going into some states that are purple and blue. </s> <s> To me, the guy can do it. </s> <s> @-@Not all of Mr. Christie@-@s donors this year can be counted on to support him if he runs for president in 2016. </s> <s> But winning the backing of people like Mr. Swatek, who can raise money from a wide variety of sources, helps the governor reach potential presidential donors in other state capitals and business communities across the country. </s> <s> Mike DuHaime, Mr. Christie@-@s chief strategist, has also reached out to Mercer Reynolds, a Cincinnati executive who is one of the Republican Party@-@s top contributors and was Mr. Bush@-@s finance chair in 2000. </s> <s> Earlier this month, Mr. Christie held a fund-raiser at a Las Vegas hotel owned by the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. </s> <s> Mr. Adelson and his wife, two of the biggest contributors to Republicans last year, were listed as co-hosts and each gave Mr. Christie the maximum contribution of @-@3,800. </s> <s> Of course, the governor has a long way to go to prove to Republicans nationally that he can be the party standard-bearer, and some conservative activists are still smarting over his embrace of President Obama in the days after Hurricane Sandy. </s> <s> And New Jersey voters may resent what they see as his exploiting state issues to appeal to the conservative wing of the national party. </s> <s> The governor recently vetoed @-@7.5 million in family planning spending and Friday@-@vetoed three gun-control measures. </s> <s> Barbara Buono, his opponent in the governor@-@s race, frequently says he @-@would rather be campaigning in the cornfields of Iowa. </s> <s> @-@ According to an analysis by Democrats, since last August Mr. Christie was outside of New Jersey for all or part of 91 days, or roughly 24 percent of the time. </s> <s> Mr. Christie emphasized that much of that out-of-state travel was for nonpolitical trips. </s> <s> @-@Senior Republicans who are familiar with Mr. Christie@-@s strategy say it is most closely modeled after Mr. Bush@-@s bid in 1998 for re-election as governor of Texas. </s> <s> The parallels are clear. </s> <s> Mr. Bush was considered a shoo-in for re-election to the governor@-@s office, but he and Mr. Rove became determined to win over Hispanic and black voters to demonstrate the governor@-@s broad appeal to a national audience. </s> <s> Mr. Bush won that race, with 68 percent of the vote, which included more than a third of the Hispanic vote, offering him a powerful credential when he ran for president two years later as @-@a different kind of Republican. </s> <s> @-@This summer, Mr. Christie established a bilingual campaign office in Paterson, N. J., and spent @-@275,000 on a Spanish-language television ad. </s> <s> He has also announced a Hispanics for Christie coalition and is now running even among Hispanic voters against Ms. Buono, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released 10 days ago. </s> <s> @-@He@-@s going to emphasize first trying to win a big re-election with a diverse coalition behind him,@-@ Mr. Rove said. </s> <s> Despite his lead, Mr. Christie is spending expansively to enhance his targeting of voters this year. </s> <s> While his core team is filled with fixtures of presidential politics @-@ including Mr. DuHaime, the ad man Russell J.

reason, and ample time, to travel the country, meet with activists and candidates, and raise unlimited money for the association, freed from federal and state regulations that limit him as governor

president the Republican base loathes, and is too quick to throw an elbow at other Republicans, as he did with Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky on national security issues last month. </s> <s> William Kristol, the editor of the conservative Weekly Standard who recently met privately with Mr. Christie over pizza, said the governor must avoid being seen as the Republican who likes to beat up on his

Iowa has never exactly been a place that feels like home for the Clintons. </s> <s> Bill Clinton did not compete in the 1992 first-in-the-nation caucuses because Tom Harkin, Iowa@-@s veteran Democratic senator and favorite son, was running for the presidential nomination. </s> <s> And when Hillary Rodham Clinton sought the presidency in 2008, her campaign considered pulling out of the state. </s> <s> Then New York@-@s junior senator, she mused publicly about the @-@special obstacle@-@ she faced running as a woman here, and she came in third place. </s> <s> So it was understandable that at a forum here Friday to discuss electing a woman president, there was more than a touch of pleading to some of the discussion about why Mrs. Clinton should return to the state that proved so unwelcoming. </s> <s> @-@It@-@s a new playing field, it@-@s a new ballgame, it@-@s apples and oranges,@-@ said Jessica Vanden Berg, a Democratic strategist who grew up in Iowa, reaching for the right metaphor to make the case that the 2016 caucuses would be far friendlier to Mrs. Clinton. </s> <s> To buttress her point, Ms. Vanden Berg noted that Emily@-@s List, which works to elect female Democrats who support abortion rights, had filled a small room to capacity with about 100 Iowans on a gorgeous Friday morning in the heart of vacation season, nearly two and a half years before the next caucuses. </s> <s> Ostensibly they were there to support the general notion of breaking the gender barrier in presidential politics. </s> <s> But the repeated applause at the mention of Mrs. Clinton@-@s name made explicit what is implicit in Emily@-@s List@-@s @-@Madam President@-@ campaign, which will next move to New Hampshire and Nevada, two other early nominating states. </s> <s> Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who has already announced her support for Mrs. Clinton should she run, joined the forum and got to the point quickly. </s> <s> @-@Look at the groundswell of interest and support: it@-@s pretty unusual in American politics to have this,@-@ Ms. McCaskill, a supporter of Mr. Obama in 2008, said in an interview. </s> <s> @-@Everywhere I go, women and men are saying, Hillary Clinton is the candidate, she@-@s the right candidate, we want Hillary Clinton. </s> <s> And typically we@-@re all fighting with each other at this point in time. </s> <s> @-@That many Democratic activists and officials, especially women, are pining for Mrs. Clinton to run for president was evident here. </s> <s> But that was not the only notion looming over the conversation. </s> <s> Democrats here know that their state, which has produced proud liberals from Henry Wallace to John Culver to Mr. Harkin, has never elected a female governor, senator or member of the House. </s> <s> It is an ignoble distinction Iowa shares only with Mississippi, and it is something Mrs. Clinton brought up when she ran in 2008 and is undoubtedly conscious of still. </s> <s> The women gathered Friday at a restored downtown arts facility were conscious of it as well. </s> <s> During the event, Emily@-@s List sent reporters an e-mail with a poll that they released to an Iowa newspaper, The Quad-City Times, showing that 96 percent of Democratic caucusgoers would consider voting for a woman. </s> <s> @-@It@-@s time to stop saying that women can@-@t win in Iowa,@-@ said Ms. Vanden Berg, who last year managed the high-profile Congressional campaign of Christie Vilsack and said Ms. Vilsack would have won had she run in a different Iowa district. </s> <s> @-@We know women can win here,@-@ added Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily@-@s List. </s> <s> @-@This state is more than ready. </s> <s> @-@The 2014 race will test that. </s> <s> Three women are vying for the Democratic nomination for an open Congressional seat; another Democratic woman is challenging Representative Tom Latham, a Republican; and a Republican woman is running for the Senate seat that will be left open by Mr. Harkin, who announced in January that he would retire. </s> <s> @-@It has taken a while to get experienced women in the pipeline to run,@-@ said Staci Appel, a stockbroker and former state senator who will challenge Mr. Latham in Iowa@-@s Third District, and participated in the forum here. </s> <s> Other veteran Iowa Democrats attribute the lack of women elected to high office to circumstance: running in difficult years or in challenging races. </s> <s> Mrs. Clinton falls into the latter category, said Patty Judge, a former state agriculture secretary and lieutenant governor. </s> <s> Speaking a bit more candidly than the other Clinton supporters here, Ms. Judge said, @-@I believe that Hillary did not have as strong a campaign here as Barack Obama. </s> <s> @-@Iowa politics, she continued, is @-@about touching people,@-@ and she said that Mrs. Clinton had learned that lesson. </s> <s> @-@I think Hillary@-@s people learned a lot and think when she comes back here this time, she@-@s going to understand the need for that strong ground game,@-@ Ms. Judge said. </s> <s> She also said gender challenges were not completely gone for female candidates here. </s> <s> @-@I managed to get elected agriculture secretary, and then for eight years I would find people that would tell me, @-@I really didn@-@t think that was a job for a woman and

Jeff Link, a seasoned Iowa veteran who was an outside adviser in 2012; and Erik Smith, an advertising consultant for the 2012 campaign, whose work running one of the biggest 2004 pro-Kerry outside groups gave him an inside track with party donors from the corporate world. </s> <s> McLean was their first hire. </s> <s> During the campaign he proved himself to be particularly deft at translating between the old hands of the political world, who talk about @-@message@-@ and @-@narrative,@-@ and the quants in their 20s, who speak of @-@code@-@ and @-@algorithms. </s> <s> @-@McLean was so moved by Obama@-@s 2004 convention speech @-@ the one that called for an end to a red-state America and a blue-state America @-@ that when Obama decided to run in 2008, he took a leave from law school and joined the campaign. </s> <s> He had just spent the last 18 months of the 2012 presidential race bouncing between a couch in Washington and a small, shared apartment in Chicago where a colleague slept in the dining room. </s> <s> So he was experiencing considerable culture shock in the high life of Vegas. </s> <s> Arriving at Caesars Palace after a first-class flight @-@only the second of his life@-@, he was shown to his room. </s> <s> @-@I open the door and there@-@s just this huge, like, double, wall-to-wall window with a view of the strip and a huge king bed,@-@ he said. </s> <s> Over room service, he met with his deputy, Chris Frommann, now 26, and made some last-minute revisions to their proposal. </s> <s> McLean took an iPhone picture of his kung pao chicken and sent it to his wife back in Brooklyn, @-@to show her that I@-@d made it,@-@ he joked. </s> <s> The next morning McLean, Frommann, Grisolano, Smith and a couple of others were escorted through a maze of doors that led them to the casino@-@s marble-and-glass executive offices, where their meeting went well enough that they scheduled another, to discuss a deal. </s> <s> Later that night they celebrated with a red-meat-and-red-wine dinner at Old Homestead, Caesars@-@ upscale steakhouse. </s> <s> Recalling that Vegas trip while sitting at a MacBook Pro-dotted coffee shop in Brooklyn in March, McLean treated his shift from selling Obama to selling Caesars as a small discomfort that was necessary if he wanted to keep working on the technological advancements he and his colleagues developed on the campaign. </s> <s> In a nonpresidential year, no political effort would have the money to finance what he described as the @-@huge R.@-@ D. project@-@ that the Obama campaign effectively became. </s> <s> The resources for that kind of project could now be found only in corporate America. </s> <s> If companies with big budgets wanted members of Obama@-@s team to do for them whatever it was that they did for the president, McLean couldn@-@t see why they shouldn@-@t answer the call. </s> <s> Political marketing has usually lagged behind commercial marketing. </s> <s> Companies that spend billions of dollars a year developing ways to make many more billions of dollars a year tend to have little to learn from presidential campaigns, which are generally start-ups aimed at a one-day sale. </s> <s> But the @-@re@-@selling of the president, 2012, was an entirely different matter. </s> <s> The campaign recruited the best young minds in the booming fields of analytics and behavioral science and placed them in a room they called @-@the cave@-@ for up to 16 hours a day over the course of roughly 16 months. </s> <s> After the election, when the technology wizards finally came out, they had not only helped produce a victory that defied a couple of historical predictors; they also developed a host of highly effective marketing techniques that were either entirely new or had never been tried on such a grand scale. </s> <s> Grisolano and McLean and the others were part of a singular breakthrough in the field of television-ad buying, where about 50 percent of the campaign@-@s budget was spent, or more than @-@400 million. </s> <s> Previous campaigns would make decisions about how to direct their television-advertising budgets largely based on hunches and deductions about what channels the voters they wanted to reach were watching. </s> <s> Their choices were informed by the broad viewership ratings of Nielsen and other survey data, which typically led to buying relatively expensive ads during evening-news and prime-time viewing hours. </s> <s> The 2012 campaign took advantage of advanced set-top-box monitoring technology to figure out what shows the voters they wanted to reach were watching and when, resulting in a smarter and cheaper @-@ if potentially more invasive @-@ way to beam commercials into their homes. </s> <s> The system gave Obama a significant advantage over Mitt Romney, according to Democrats and many Republicans @-@at least those who were not on Romney@-@s media team@-@. </s> <s> Now A.

G.@-@s founders say the company is at the forefront of a move to turn upside down the way the @-@60-billion-a-year television-ad market has functioned since its start. </s> <s> And they hope to get very rich in the process. </s> <s> That is essentially the pitch Grisolano began making just before Christmas to the tech whizzes he needed to hire to rebuild the system they used during the campaign. </s> <s> He also offered profit sharing and salaries often commensurate with those being offered by Facebook or Google, who were also recruiting from the Obama campaign. </s> <s> @-@You@-@re sort of involved in this cutting edge of something and see this whole thing on the horizon changing,@-@ Grisolano recounted telling them. </s> <s> @-@I think that@-@s exciting. </s> <s> @-@McLean, for one, was primed to hear his message. </s> <s> When the election was won last fall, he asked Jim Messina, Obama@-@s innovative campaign manager @-@ and ardent tech advocate @-@ what he should do with his life. </s> <s> As McLean tells it, and Messina affirms, Messina said, @-@I@-@d either go out into the country and run a campaign or I@-@d go make a load of money. </s> <s> @-@A couple of weeks before Election Day, over drinks at the Pump Room in Chicago@-@s Gold Coast, a safe distance away from the re-election headquarters and its press minders, Grisolano and Erik Smith first let on that there was far more happening in the Chicago campaign office than any of us covering it truly understood. </s> <s> Grisolano told me that the campaign literally knew every single wavering voter in the country that it needed to persuade to vote for Obama, by name, address, race, sex and income. </s> <s> What@-@s more, he hinted, the campaign had figured out how to get its television advertisements in front of them with a previously inconceivable level of knowledge and accuracy. </s> <s> Grisolano, a gruff and stocky Iowan, spent years in the shadow of his mentor, Obama@-@s founding strategist, David Axelrod, happily so, but he now seemed eager for his own recognition. </s> <s> There was also no mistaking that he believed he had figured something out that would be worth a lot of money after the election. </s> <s> He wouldn@-@t say more, at least not then. </s> <s> But after the election, in February, he began to describe his new business venture to me in detail. </s> <s> To understand how it works, you must first understand the vast technological engine that powered the campaign but remained largely out of view of the public and the press. </s> <s> Messina, the campaign manager, often boasted about how the Obama 2012 effort would be @-@the most data-driven campaign ever. </s> <s> @-@ But what that truly meant @-@ the extent to which the campaign used the newest tech tools to look into people@-@s lives and the sheer amount of personal data its vast servers were crunching @-@ remained largely shrouded. </s> <s> The secrecy around the operation was partly because the president@-@s strategists wanted to maintain their competitive edge. </s> <s> But it was also no doubt because they worried that practices like @-@data mining@-@ and @-@analytics@-@ could make voters uncomfortable. </s> <s> Using data wasn@-@t new for the Obama strategists. </s> <s> The 2008 campaign developed the most sophisticated system to date to identify tens of millions of voters and place them into useful categories: those most likely to vote Republican, who would be ignored; those supporting Obama @-@ and how likely they were to vote. </s> <s> That system @-@ based on a complicated scoring method that relied on the processing of reams of data @-@ was first devised by an outside consultant, Ken Strasma. </s> <s> But it was partly managed inside the campaign by an economics forecaster, Dan Wagner, who, at 24, helped perfect it for the campaign@-@s use. </s> <s> Wagner, who was recruited by A. M.

M. G., became so good that when the president visited the campaign office during the summer, the staff volunteered Shirole to compete against Obama. </s> <s> @-@Shirole won, but got in trouble with his mother when she saw the photo of him playing in flip-flops and a T-shirt. </s> <s> @-@Yet in truth, their task was daunting. </s> <s> Shortly after Messina opened the Chicago offices, Joel Benenson, the president@-@s national pollster, conducted a @-@benchmark@-@ poll that had some sobering results. </s> <s> Roughly a fifth of Obama@-@s 2008 vote had shifted into the undecided column. </s> <s> @-@We knew we weren@-@t going to get all of them,@-@ Benenson said. </s> <s> But the campaign needed to get back many millions of them. </s> <s> And it fell to Wagner@-@s team to figure out exactly who they were, to a man and to a woman, and then rank them according to a 0 to 10 persuasion score. </s> <s> As the denizens of the cave were setting out to do that, the digital-analytics team, led by Rayid Ghani, a 35-year-old research scientist from Accenture Labs, developed an idea: Why not try sifting through self-described supporters@-@ Facebook pages in search of friends who might be on the campaign@-@s list of the most persuadable voters? </s> <s> Then the campaign could ask the self-identified supporters to bring their undecided friends along. </s> <s> The technique, as they saw it, could also get supporters to urge friends to register to vote, to vote early or to volunteer and donate. </s> <s> Identifying persuadable friends became a significant undertaking. </s> <s> @-@We ended up building it from scratch because nothing like that existed,@-@ Ghani told me. </s> <s> The computer code alone was thousands of lines, said Will St. Clair, 25, who helped write it and who also now works with McLean at A. M. G. The campaign didn@-@t go into much detail, at the time, about exactly how it used Facebook. </s> <s> But St. Clair put it in fairly stark terms when I talked to him at A. M. G.@-@s temporary offices in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in April. </s> <s> They started with a list that grew to a million people who had signed into the campaign Web site through Facebook. </s> <s> When people opted to do so, they were met with a prompt asking to grant the campaign permission to scan their Facebook friends lists, their photos and other personal information. </s> <s> In another prompt, the campaign asked for access to the users@-@ Facebook news feeds, which 25 percent declined, St. Clair said. </s> <s> Once permission was granted, the campaign had access to millions of names and faces they could match against their lists of persuadable voters, potential donors, unregistered voters and so on. </s> <s> @-@It would take us 5 to 10 seconds to get a friends list and match it against the voter list,@-@ St. Clair said. </s> <s> They found matches about 50 percent of the time, he said. </s> <s> But the campaign@-@s ultimate goal was to deputize the closest Obama-supporting friends of voters who were wavering in their affections for the president. </s> <s> @-@We would grab the top 50 you were most active with and then crawl their wall@-@ to figure out who were most likely to be their real-life friends, not just casual Facebook acquaintances. </s> <s> St. Clair, a former high-school marching-band member who now wears a leather Diesel jacket, explained: @-@We asked to see photos but really we were looking for who were tagged in photos with you, which was a really great way to dredge up old college friends @-@ and ex-girlfriends,@-@ he said. </s> <s> The campaign@-@s exhaustive use of Facebook triggered the site@-@s internal safeguards. </s> <s> @-@It was more like we blew through an alarm that their engineers hadn@-@t planned for or knew about,@-@ said St. Clair, who had been working at a small firm in Chicago and joined the campaign at the suggestion of a friend. </s> <s> @-@They@-@d sigh and say, @-@You can do this as long as you stop doing it on Nov. </s> <s> 7. </s> <s> @-@ @-@ @-@Facebook officials say warning bells go off when the site sees large amounts of unusual activity, but in each case the company was satisfied the campaign was not violating its privacy and data standards. </s> <s> @-@By March 2012, Wagner@-@s team had a workable list of what it deemed to be the most persuadable voters @-@ in total, roughly 15 million of them in the swing states. </s> <s> Messina ordered the campaign to direct a majority of its efforts toward winning them back, one by one if necessary. </s> <s> They could reach many through their Facebook friends and others through more conventional means like e-mail and knocking on doors. </s> <s> But how could the Obama campaign be as targeted and tech-savvy on TV?The Internet, and specifically social media, may have fundamentally changed politics, but there is still nothing with the power to enrage or inspire like a well-produced television ad @-@see @-@47 percent, Romney@-@. </s> <s> This is in part because of the evocative nature of video, which can be transmitted over the Internet as well. </s> <s> But it@-@s also because that imagery is typically put in front of people when they are at their most receptive, zoning out on the couch, relaxing, their defenses down. </s> <s> TV advertising has also historically been the most expensive and least efficient way to reach voters. </s> <s> Commercial TV time is still valued and sold in pretty much the same way as it was when people gathered every night to watch Walter Cronkite. </s> <s> Most advertising is based on audience ratings kept by Nielsen Media Research, which derives its information from a national survey of 22,000 households and smaller surveys in local markets, selected to perfectly represent the American television-viewing population, Nielsen says. </s> <s> Through @-@people meters@-@ that monitor what specific members of these households are watching in real time and, in some cases, written diaries of its participating families, Nielsen does a reasonably good job of telling advertisers which demographic groups are watching which shows. </s> <s> Nielsen@-@s ratings categories are still dominated by the broad audience segment known as @-@adults 18 to 49,@-@ but they can also include smaller groups like @-@women 18-plus@-@ and @-@Hispanics. </s> <s> @-@ If Revlon wants to sell its newest shade of lipstick, for example, it knows it can reach lots of women through a show like @-@Grey@-@s Anatomy. </s> <s> @-@ If Miller Lite wants to get its shiny blue cans in front of young men in their beer-drinking prime, it knows it can do so through spots on @-@Jimmy Kimmel Live. </s> <s> @-@Political campaigns have typically shown most of their ads during news programs, where they can reach older viewers who are engaged in the topics of the day and, it stands to reason, are most likely to vote. </s> <s> If a pollster identified other broad groups that a candidate wanted to reach, like women or young men, then the campaign could venture out into other shows. </s> <s> Traditionally, @-@these are the tools that you have,@-@ Grisolano told me one day at his office in Chicago, the L train screeching along the rails outside. </s> <s> @-@You have programming that overdelivers or underdelivers in broad, sweeping groups. </s> <s> @-@The better that campaigns @-@ and all major marketers @-@ have become at identifying precisely whom they want to talk to, the more inefficient the old model can seem. </s> <s> For instance, a campaign may need to win over those 5 percent of independent, female, likely voters who are still undecided, but there is no separate ratings category for them, no precise way to know which shows they are watching. </s> <s> It@-@s very likely a campaign can speak to some of them through commercials on @-@Grey@-@s Anatomy,@-@ but by buying time there, the campaign is spending a lot of money on an audience that is mostly made up of people the candidate actually does not need to speak to. </s> <s> The 2012 Obama campaign knew it had to be especially efficient in buying television time because it expected to be outspent by the combined forces of the Romney campaign and super PACs, including the American Crossroads organization, co-founded by Karl Rove. </s> <s> @-@If we had to withstand being outspent @-@ and nobody wanted to withstand it @-@ but if we had to, we could tolerate being outspent with the people who have basically already made up their mind for us or the people who made up their mind against us,@-@ Grisolano said. </s> <s> @-@But we were going to make sure that we put the full power of our buy with the people who were swing voters, who were on the edge. </s> <s> So, my task became, how do you create the tools you need to make that a reality? </s> <s> @-@Grisolano was going to have one thing at his disposal that no presidential adviser had before him: Wagner@-@s list of roughly 15 million persuadable voters. </s> <s> But he had no way of knowing if he would be able to reach them with any real precision on TV. </s> <s> He turned to Amy Gershkoff, a young political scientist he met a couple of years before who was making a name for herself grappling with just these sorts of challenges. </s> <s> Gershkoff was 30 years old, had a Ph. </s> <s> D. from Princeton and had developed software that was making political ad buying more efficient. </s> <s> Gershkoff was digging more deeply into the Nielsen data and matching it against information in party-voter lists to get a better read on what shows key voting blocs @-@ not generic television audiences @-@ were watching. </s> <s> She was finding that a campaign could reach many of them in greater concentrations and for less money on cable channels like Lifetime than on more expensive shows with bigger audiences like @-@The Office. </s> <s> @-@Grisolano recommended that Messina speak with her, and Messina hired her to be director of media planning, reporting directly to him. </s> <s> Messina wanted Gershkoff to build a master program that would allow him, as the campaign manager, to decide how to spend the campaign@-@s advertising budget across all mediums @-@ not just television, but the Internet, radio, print ads and the mail @-@ at optimum cost using real-time polling data to measure how the ads were moving or not moving opinion. </s> <s> @-@A version of this project would be built by McLean, whom Gershkoff brought with her, and Frommann, his deputy. </s> <s> @-@But it soon became clear that such a system could eliminate the role of Obama@-@s longtime television-ad-buying firm, GMMB, run by the senior Obama strategist Jim Margolis, which stood to potentially lose millions in buying commissions. </s> <s> Colleagues described Margolis as furious. </s> <s> He called it @-@dumbfounded. </s> <s> @-@ Grisolano and Axelrod backed him up in his argument that any savings on commissions would be wiped out in the chaos of recreating a system that already existed @-@and forgoing the expertise and relationships that Margolis@-@s 30-person buying team had in the television world@-@. </s> <s> Messina relented, but said that GMMB would take guidance from Gershkoff@-@s department. </s> <s> As Gershkoff put it to me gingerly when we spoke in May: @-@Fundamentally I was brought in to create tools that would help Jim spend nine digits@-@ worth of the campaign@-@s budget. </s> <s> Any time you@-@re moving that kind of money around, people can be resistant to the idea. </s> <s> @-@There were other turf battles. </s> <s> Gershkoff was given her own analytics department to analyze media, but Wagner believed all analytics should be handled uniformly through his department, several former campaign officials said. </s> <s> @-@He wouldn@-@t discuss it with me when I asked about it. </s> <s> @-@ The two had differences in other areas as well. </s> <s> Gershkoff insisted that her staff members wear business attire; Wagner, who often wore flip-flops, had only one requirement of his staff in the cave: @-@You have to wear clothes. </s> <s> @-@But Gershkoff had come upon a cache of data that all the strategists would come to appreciate. </s> <s> She had contracted with a relatively new firm called Rentrak that was competing with Nielsen and was buying up real-time, raw viewing data directly from cable and satellite companies that had nearly 20 million set-top boxes in eight million homes. </s> <s> When Gershkoff told Grisolano, he was thrilled. </s> <s> Rentrak@-@s huge new trove of data, he surmised, could help him find out with relative certainty what shows were being delivered to the homes of the roughly 15 million persuadable voters Wagner@-@s department had identified. </s> <s> The concept for the @-@optimizer,@-@ as it was known in the campaign, was born: a system that could determine with more precision than ever what swing voters were watching in the greatest concentrations and how to get commercials in front of them in the cheapest advertising time slots possible. </s> <s> But making that idea a reality was going to be very difficult. </s> <s> @-@My first idea was, O. K., I@-@ve got a list of people who I know are targets here,@-@ Grisolano said. </s> <s> @-@I@-@ve got a list of viewers and what they watch over here. </s> <s> Just match them up and spit out what TV shows my targets are watching. </s> <s> @-@ He acknowledged that @-@what I didn@-@t necessarily fully grasp in my enthusiastic na@-@vet@-@ was that the size and magnitude of these data sets are apparently extraordinary, and the engineering feat of doing what I wanted to do was a lot more complicated than I envisioned it. </s> <s> @-@That task would not ultimately be overseen by Gershkoff. </s> <s> By the end of 2011, she left the campaign, her tenure cut short by a family emergency, she said. </s> <s> When she re-emerged that spring, it was as the director of global analytics at the public relations and advertising firm Burson-Marsteller. </s> <s> Responsibility for building the optimizer was handed off to Wagner. </s> <s> @-@We took over in January and then had to build it from scratch, completely from scratch,@-@ he said. </s> <s> Fortunately, there happened to be a rare expert in set-top-box data, named Carol Davidsen, working in the cave. </s> <s> Davidsen looks younger than her 37 years @-@ @-@no kids,@-@ she says @-@ and she speaks in a rapid, elliptical manner, as if her thoughts are running too fast for her sentences to keep pace. </s> <s> Before joining the campaign, she had a successful career as a forward-thinking data engineer. </s> <s> But she had become fed up with corporate life by the time she received an unsolicited e-mail from Wagner@-@s analytics department, which recruited employees by searching the 2008 online-donor list for those who listed themselves as programmers. </s> <s> @-@I@-@m a huge supporter of Barack Obama,@-@ she said a few weeks ago at Think Coffee in Greenwich Village. </s> <s> @-@But I also was kind of at a time in my life where I needed to be part of a perfect team, and I knew that was possible in a world where people weren@-@t worried about getting a raise or people weren@-@t worried about getting a promotion. </s> <s> @-@Her previous employer, Navic Networks, was a very early pioneer in the field of set-top-box data collection. </s> <s> And she was one of the early programmers to figure out how to make a television, designed as a one-way path for sending programming into American homes, relay information back about what exactly a viewer was watching. </s> <s> Davidsen determined that Rentrak could roughly do what Grisolano wanted it to do: produce data that could be checked against Wagner@-@s list of most-persuadable voters to find matches. </s> <s> Rentrak had access to the set-top boxes in the homes of thousands of the targeted voters in every competitive market of every swing state. </s> <s> @-@For instance, Rentrak had 100,000 people in its Denver sample, some 20,000 of whom were on the Obama list; Nielsen had a total of 600 people in Denver. </s> <s> @-@But there was the potentially politically explosive matter of privacy. </s> <s> Unlike Facebook, where users were at least giving the campaign explicit permission to collect personal data even if they had not read the fine print, television watchers were making no such agreement. </s> <s> To address this, the campaign and Rentrak hired a third party to @-@anonymize@-@ the data so that they would only know that the information was coming from a set-top box of somebody on the persuadable list; identifying information would be stripped away. </s> <s> The optimizer software would then comb advertising price and viewership data to figure out the top-rated time slots among those on the Obama persuadable list @-@ which could vary from market to market @-@ and then rank them based on which produced the highest concentration of the Obama swing voters at the best rates. </s> <s> The results were striking. </s> <s> The campaign determined that two of the top shows to buy were 1 a.m. repeats of @-@The Insider@-@ and afternoon episodes of @-@Judge Joe Brown@-@ @-@ shows that were far cheaper than the evening news or anything being shown on the networks in prime time. </s> <s> @-@When you@-@re talking about @-@The Insider,@-@ that might be shift workers in a state like Ohio, folks who are working class and aren@-@t getting home until midnight,@-@ said Daniel Jester, the head GMMB buyer, who was aggressively locking in low rates early. </s> <s> @-@The person watching @-@Judge Joe Brown@-@ in the afternoon also may be the same viewer watching @-@The Insider@-@ at 1 a.m.@-@The Romney campaign was not pursuing these same voters the same way. </s> <s> If they had been, Davidsen told me, the market would have become competitive, prices would have spiked and the system would have lost some of its advantage. </s> <s> As far as the Obama team was concerned, the optimizer helped it do what most strategists deemed impossible in a campaign between two well-financed opponents @-@ talk to undecided voters through television advertisements on shows on which the opposition was not running a countermessage. </s> <s> By Election Day, the Obama campaign had done far more to utilize cable and to run ads at odd times of day @-@ who watches @-@Area 51@-@ on Syfy at 2:30 a.m.? </s> <s> @-@ than Romney had. </s> <s> In all, Obama ran nearly twice as many cable ads as Romney did, 588,006, on more than twice as many channels, 100, according to analysis by NCC Media, which helped both campaigns place spots. </s> <s> It is not that the Romney campaign was unaware such technology could be developed. </s> <s> Rentrak, a nonpartisan vendor, reached out to offer its services in the spring of 2012 but found no takers. </s> <s> The former Bush strategist Sara Fagen worked with the Romney consulting firm TargetPoint to develop a competing optimizing service, but, she said, the media team @-@chose not to use it. </s> <s> @-@ @-@She is now working with some TargetPoint colleagues to develop one for a new company they are forming, Deep Root Analytics. </s> <s> @-@Stuart Stevens, Romney@-@s chief strategist, said the campaign used plenty of data to inform its television buying. </s> <s> But as far as he was concerned, Fagen was one of many offering some new service. </s> <s> The Romney campaign, he said, had a different mission than Obama@-@s. @-@We still were trying to inform likely voters who Mitt Romney was,@-@ he said, @-@and until you get those voters, you@-@re insane to go off and say, @-@We@-@re going to try to win this with left-handed Lithuanians. </s> <s> @-@ @-@In the end, an analysis by the Republican ad-buying firm National Media found that Obama paid roughly 35 percent less per broadcast commercial than Romney did. </s> <s> Kantar Media CMAG, an ad-monitoring firm, showed that Obama and his supporting super PAC got nearly 40,000 more spots on the air than Romney and his super PACs did despite spending roughly @-@90 million less. </s> <s> The day after Obama won 51 percent of the vote, he visited his Chicago staff, including those on the analytics team. </s> <s> Davidsen said Obama hugged her and signed a favorite piece of cave paraphernalia, a replica of a narwhal tusk. </s> <s> @-@An honor,@-@ she said. </s> <s> When the campaign ended, Obama@-@s team of tech experts did not exactly knock down the door of the White House personnel office looking to put their newfound tools into the service of the new presidential agenda. </s> <s> They were heading East and West @-@ to Silicon Valley, Wall Street and, in the case of A. M. G., Las Vegas @-@ in search of venture capital and clients. </s> <s> There is, of course, a tradition of political operatives leaving presidential campaigns to cash in on the corporate side. </s> <s> This has often been to join the public-policy campaigns of a given industry or company between political bouts, or perhaps to help with some brand and image management. </s> <s> But there is just as much of a tradition in Democratic politics, especially among the young, to keep the fight alive after a campaign@-@s end. </s> <s> The young staff members of the McGovern campaign left that particularly demoralizing endeavor to re-engage with their causes and their party; the Web-pioneering Deaniacs went on to feed the ranks of MoveOn and the 2008 Obama campaign. </s> <s> The Obama political movement had tended to hold itself apart from the corporate world, its members galvanized by what they saw as an opportunity to change the country. </s> <s> But after Election Day in November, huge political success met financial opportunity. </s> <s> The people in their 20s and 30s from the Obama tech team had seen others just like them get incredibly rich on innovations @-@Facebook, Twitter, etc. </s> <s> @-@ that were as transformational as anything they could hope to achieve in government. </s> <s> Now they started to think about what innovations they could bring to the market. </s> <s> A. M. G. may be the most baldly commercial of the new crop of companies coming out of the cave, but they are all trying to translate what they learned there into future success. </s> <s> A few weeks ago, Wagner announced he was starting a new firm called Civis Analytics with an investment from Eric Schmidt, the Google executive chairman, who was a technology adviser during the campaign. </s> <s> As Wagner described it to me, he would use analytics to help nonprofit and for-profit companies reach out to segments of the population they were struggling to connect with. </s> <s> One of his first clients is the College Board, which runs the national SAT test. </s> <s> Civis will identify @-@kids who are low-income, high-achieving but not meeting their college potential. </s> <s> @-@ The @-@commercial applicability is wide,@-@ he said, so the company will not be averse to working with big, for-profit companies of all kinds. </s> <s> Carol Davidsen was also recruited by A. M. G., but she decided to take the lessons of the Obama campaign in a different direction. </s> <s> If anything, her approach is almost anticorporate, even though she said she was not against getting rich if she could. </s> <s> Her company, called Cir.cl, which she founded with a campaign programmer, Joshua Thayer, endeavors to find people with complementary interests who may have reason to do business with each other, like parents with baby equipment to dispose of and parents-to-be in the market for that equipment. </s> <s> She calls it @-@recommerce. </s> <s> @-@I have a lot of friends with kids,@-@ she said one recent Friday at her new office, a bouncy-ball and Mac-strewn onetime closet space in an industrial building in Downtown Brooklyn. </s> <s> @-@There@-@s this little plastic play house. </s> <s> Does every single one of those need to go into a garbage dump? </s> <s> Why did we give up on doing business with each other? </s> <s> Why is it always to big corporations? </s> <s> It doesn@-@t have to be. </s> <s> @-@ Explaining her choice to me, she said, @-@I don@-@t want to spend my time optimizing for Coke. </s> <s> @-@When I talked to Chauncey McLean in Brooklyn in April, he walked me through how the campaign@-@s technological achievements could translate into services provided to private businesses, like Caesars. </s> <s> The casino had gobs of data on its customers. </s> <s> @-@We have a giant list of people, and we need to make a model of likely customers,@-@ he said. </s> <s> A.

intense racial consciousness that he had nurtured in his own mind since childhood was more apparent in private. </s> <s> He knew that if he crossed a certain line in reacting to criticism, he would

@-@stifling of himself,@-@ this @-@inability to swing at certain pitches,@-@ made him, according to one aide, about @-@5 percent more aloof than he had been before coming to the presidency. </s> <s> @-@A similar sort of dynamic, in Mr. Alter@-@s opinion, helps explain the president@-@s dismal first debate, which jeopardized his re-election: @-@Obama didn@-@t trust himself to tangle with Romney.

Suppressing that was part of what threw him off his game@-@ in that Denver debate. </s> <s> Such observations help propel the well-worn narrative of the presidential campaign forward, and Mr. Alter

<s> @-@ Those efforts failed, says Mr. Alter, instead creating a backlash against Republicans as a wave of black voters headed to the polls in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia and Florida, angry at attempts to suppress their votes. </s> <s> Over all, however, the long passages in this book recounting the 2012 presidential campaign feel like tired television reruns of a not-too-popular show. </s> <s> The only sections that substantially add to our understanding of the campaign are those chronicling, in minute detail, the Obama team@-@s creation of a sophisticated operation for reaching out to

Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, told me. </s> <s> @-@He has to become a serious candidate. </s> <s> At that point she would find him much more complex than dealing with liberals. </s> <s> He@-@s not a liberal, but a lot of what he says might appeal to liberals. </s> <s> He does not get carried away by humanitarian intervention.@-@Mr. </s> <s> Webb@-@s attacks on free trade and economic elites, coupled with a call for America to come home again, might well prove a potent combination in the early primaries, attracting antiwar progressives as well as conservative-minded Southern white men whom he believes the party can win back. </s> <s> His credo is as simple as it is persuasive: Rather than squander its power and resources abroad, America should rebuild. </s> <s> Mr. Webb, whose national poll ratings are negligible, may look like an unlikely candidate, but that is also what most observers thought when he wore his son@-@s Iraq combat boots on the campaign trail and ousted George Allen from his Senate seat in 2006. </s> <s> Today he represents for the Democrats what the Republicans tried to stamp out in their ranks during the midterm elections: a Tea-Party-like insurgency against its establishment candidate. </s> <s> Mr. Webb, who prides himself on his Scotch-Irish ancestry, has long been something of a renegade, a persona that vividly manifested itself after Sept. 11, 2001, when he began denouncing what he saw as the transformation of the American presidency into a European-style monarchy that could capriciously pursue wars whenever and wherever it chose. </s> <s> Unlike Mrs. Clinton, who continues to struggle to explain her vote for the Iraq war, Mr. Webb publicly attacked the George W. Bush administration in 2002, presciently asking, @-@Do we really want to occupy Iraq for the next 30 years? </s> <s> @-@ As a member of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees he also castigated the Obama administration for its intervention in Libya in 2011. </s> <s> He was right. </s> <s> It@-@s a move that has boomeranged, creating further instability and emboldening jihadists across the region. </s> <s> During and after the Libya intervention, Mr. Webb made it clear that he believed American democracy was imperiled by the failure of Congress to question the judgment of military leaders and the president. </s> <s> He has put his finger on a problem that academics like Tufts University@-@s Michael J. Glennon, the author of @-@National Security and Double Government,@-@ see as a product of an entrenched national security bureaucracy that essentially performs an end-run around Congress and even reform-minded presidents. </s> <s> In contrast to Mrs. Clinton, who has gotten into hot water for trying to retroactively amend her views and record, Mr. Webb did not arrive at these beliefs casually or opportunistically. </s> <s> As his recent memoir, @-@I Heard My Country Calling,@-@ makes clear, his opposition to ventures abroad is as much viscerally emotional as intellectual. </s> <s> Growing up as a self-described military brat, he spent his formative years in Britain, where he saw firsthand the effects of loss of empire and the devastation wrought by World War II. </s> <s> @-@Britain was bled out and spent out,@-@ he writes. </s> <s> @-@They understood the great price of the recent wars in a much more sobering way than did most Americans. </s> <s> @-@ After he returned from war-torn Beirut just before a truck suicide bomber destroyed the Marine Corps headquarters in October 1983, he felt a nagging irritation as he rode home in a taxi early in the morning along George Washington Memorial Parkway. </s> <s> Then he realized that the calm silence was bothering him; it was both the emblem of America and the @-@protective vacuum that surrounds our understanding when it comes to the viciousness that war brings to so many innocent noncombatants in other lands. </s> <s> @-@ Mr. Webb@-@s exposure to foreign societies gave him the ability, much like President Obama, to view America as both an insider and an outsider. </s> <s> Whether Mr. Webb will attempt to begin a successful maverick campaign is an open question. </s> <s> But he is an eloquent and forthright speaker whose foreign policy experience would make it difficult for Mrs. Clinton to paint him as an isolationist or a novice who will leave America open to attack, as she attempted to do to Mr. Obama during the 2008 primaries. </s> <s> On the contrary, it@-@s Mrs. Clinton whose interventionist foreign policy record leaves her politically vulnerable. </s> <s> Good Wednesday morning from Washington, which has been abandoned by both the president and Congress and where Christmas is a season to be silly. </s> <s> Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky is using his Twitter account to celebrate the Festivus holiday from @-@Seinfeld,@-@ and we share our favorite political Christmas cards. </s> <s> On more serious notes, the elder President George Bush has been @-@taken to a Houston hospital after experiencing shortness of breath, and Vice President Joseph R.

Obama began his evolution from political phenom to presidential contender with his first-ever trip to New Hampshire, a visit that attracted 2,500 voters, 150 journalists and a comparison by the state@-@s governor of Mr. Obama to the Rolling Stones. </s> <s> Last week, in the side room of Java Joe@-@s coffee shop here, the liberal group MoveOn.org took the first step to propel Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, on a similar path, holding a rally to encourage her to get into the 2016 race. </s> <s> Yet there were only about 75 people present, some of them local political professionals engaging in a bit of reconnaissance and recreation, and just a handful of reporters. </s> <s> The highest-ranking official there was the Iowa Senate president, who carefully avoided stating her support for a Warren candidacy. </s> <s> Not that there is such a thing: Ms. Warren herself was not here, and she has repeatedly stated in public that she is not running for president. </s> <s> In private, according to several Democrats who have talked with her, Ms. Warren, 65, has also indicated that she would not challenge Hillary Rodham Clinton. </s> <s> Liberals may be unhappy with the prospect of an inexorable march by Mrs. Clinton to the nomination a year and half from now, but at the moment they have no Obama-style candidate to challenge her and no clear-cut issue like the Iraq war to attack her over. </s> <s> They also face a front-runner who is far better positioned now with her own party than she was at the outset of the presidential campaign she saw slip away in 2008. </s> <s> While Ms. Warren@-@s style of populism is certainly ascendant among Democrats, in the absence of a viable messenger to carry the progressive banner, it is a political current that Mrs. Clinton can move to co-opt. </s> <s> @-@She has an unrivaled status in the party that was much less clear in 2006, when, after all, not only was Obama thinking of running, but there were a lot of credible candidates already running for president,@-@ said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama@-@s former strategist, who has been somewhat critical of Mrs. Clinton recently. </s> <s> Mrs. Clinton@-@s marathon campaign with Mr. Obama, willingness to serve as his secretary of state and potential for sweeping away yet another historical barrier from the White House have made her the best-positioned nonincumbent for a party nomination in recent history. </s> <s> When the 2008 Iowa campaign began, for example, Mrs. Clinton trailed in many polls to a former North Carolina senator, John Edwards. </s> <s> Now, she enjoys canyon-size leads. </s> <s> A Des Moines Register-Bloomberg poll in October showed Mrs. Clinton leading Ms. Warren by 43 percentage points. </s> <s> In New Hampshire, where Mrs. Clinton led Mr. Obama in a Granite State Poll at the outset of the 2008 race by 14 points, she was beating Ms. Warren by 49 points last month in a Bloomberg-Saint Anselm College survey. </s> <s> @-@There is only a very small segment of the party this time around that@-@s looking for an alternative,@-@ said Jim Demers, a New Hampshire Democrat who backed Mr. Obama in 2008 and is now supporting Mrs. Clinton. </s> <s> As Mr. Demers noted, Mr. Obama represented not only a fresh face at the time the party was hungry for change at the end of the Bush years, but he was lifted by his opposition to the American invasion of Iraq, which Mrs. Clinton voted in the Senate to authorize @-@ a decision she refused to recant. </s> <s> Progressives are hoping that a candidate can tap into anger over income inequality the same way Mr. Obama did outrage over the war, but the difference as it relates to Mrs. Clinton is that she is not as starkly on the opposite side of the party base now as she was the last time she ran. </s> <s> @-@After six years of having to pursue economic policies primarily geared toward addressing crises, the party is restless and impatient and wants to start addressing broader issues of inequality and stagnant wages,@-@ said Anita Dunn, a Democratic strategist and former top aide to Mr. Obama. </s> <s> @-@And they@-@re looking for a leader who can really articulate this anxiety. </s> <s> But that@-@s not inconsistent with saying they also want Mrs. Clinton to win the nomination.@-@Mrs. </s> <s> Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, are more associated with the Wall Street wing of the Democratic Party @-@ and she has raised tens of millions from bankers in her campaigns. </s> <s> But it is clear that she recognizes where the party is moving on economic issues. </s> <s> She has, at times awkwardly, sought to align herself with the new populism and Ms. Warren. </s> <s> It is also apparent that Ms. Warren intends to use her rising prominence to keep Mrs. Clinton on this path. </s> <s> Ms. Warren, a first-term senator, has been musing with associates in recent weeks about how to keep the party focused on questions of economic fairness, as she did with her unsuccessful attempt to stop a spending bill this month that included language that would benefit banks. </s> <s> One of the issues on Ms. Warren@-@s mind: how to protect the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she helped create, with Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress. </s> <s> She intends to give a series of speeches about these issues in the coming months, according to an associate. </s> <s> While just over two years removed from the faculty of Harvard Law School, Ms. Warren is also politically savvy enough to recognize that the way to keep drawing attention to such policy matters is by sticking with the formulation she uses when asked about a White House race: insisting, while using the present tense, that she is not running. </s> <s> Asking MoveOn.org to halt its draft efforts and issuing a full-throated endorsement for Mrs. Clinton would end the speculation, of course, but it also would mean less leverage @-@ and less ability to draw attention to questions of what her party will stand for. </s> <s> @-@She wants to ensure that the Democratic nominee makes the plight of the middle class and lack of economic mobility today a fundamental motivating plank of their candidacy,@-@ Mr. Axelrod said of Ms. Warren, calling the possibility of her running @-@a bit of fantasy. </s> <s> @-@ @-@But it is good for left-wing P. A. C.s and T-shirt makers,@-@ he joked. </s> <s> @-@A longtime friend of Ms. Warren@-@s and well-connected figure in liberal circles was even blunter. </s> <s> @-@She@-@s challenging Hillary in a different way,@-@ said this Democrat, who requested anonymity to protect his relationship with Ms. Warren. </s> <s> @-@She@-@s not attacking Hillary so much as she is attacking a model of the Democratic Party. </s> <s> And Hillary needs to figure out her relationship to that model. </s> <s> Hillary is not so much a protagonist in this as she is the battlefield on which this war is being fought. </s> <s> @-@This sentiment @-@ a desire to push if not necessarily defeat Mrs. Clinton @-@ could be found even at the rally for Ms. Warren here last week. </s> <s> Ilya Sheyman, the executive director of MoveOn.org, never mentioned Mrs. Clinton in his remarks, but the moment that got the most heads nodding and a chorus of yeses from the audience was when he spoke about process, not policy. </s> <s> @-@What we@-@ve heard loud and clear is that Iowans want a contested caucus, Iowans want candidates and issues to be debated and tested and discussed and Iowans want the strongest possible candidate,@-@ Mr. Sheyman said. </s> <s> Political CalculusBy Nate CohnThe importance of small demographic groups is often overstated by political commentators. </s> <s> The Cuban-American vote is an exception. </s> <s> Cuban-Americans represent a meaningful number of voters in a battleground state, Florida, that may be critical in the 2016 presidential election. </s> <s> Their political allegiances also seem to have shifted significantly toward Democrats in recent years, which raises the possibility that President Obama@-@s new policy could accelerate the shift @-@ or undo parts of it. </s> <s> Cuban-Americans, in short, are the rare small demographic group that could easily decide a presidential election. </s> <s> For decades, Cuban-Americans were strongly Republican. </s> <s> Their political allegiances were defined by Cold War politics, and the stridently anti-Communist Republican Party was a natural fit for Cuban immigrants who fervently opposed Fidel Castro@-@s regime in Havana. </s> <s> The Republican grip on Cuban-American voters lasted all the way through the beginning of the last decade. </s> <s> Cuban-American voters identified themselves as Republican by a margin of 64 percent to 22 percent, according to a Pew Center survey of Latino Americans in 2002. </s> <s> George Bush won 78 percent of the Cuban vote in Florida in the 2004 presidential election, according to exit polls. </s> <s> All of that changed over the past 10 years. </s> <s> The 2013 Pew survey showed that the Republican advantage among Cuban-Americans had dwindled to 3 percentage points, 47 to 44. </s> <s> The Florida exit poll in 2012 showed that Mr. Obama won the Cuban-American vote, 49 to 47 percent. </s> <s> Last month, the exit polling showed that Cuban-American voters supported the Democrat Charlie Crist, 50 to 46 percent, though he lost the governor@-@s race. </s> <s> Whether Democrats are actually winning the Cuban-American vote is a matter of some debate. </s> <s> The exit poll samples are small and they are subject to error even when they@-@re large. </s> <s> Heavily Cuban areas of Miami-Dade County, like Hialeah, continue to vote Republican @-@ though Cuban-American voters who choose to live in the most heavily Cuban areas may not be representative of the overall group@-@s preferences. </s> <s> But whether Mr. Obama received 49 or 42 percent of the Cuban-American vote is a little beside the point. </s> <s> There is no question that Republicans have suffered huge losses among Cuban-American voters over the last decade. </s> <s> Some of the Democratic gains result from generational replacement. </s> <s> The Cubans who arrived at the height of the Cold War represent a dwindling share of the population. </s> <s> Cuban-Americans of the new generation, born in the United States, have no memory of that era, and they@-@re far more likely to identify as Democrats than older Cubans, according to the Pew data. </s> <s> The exit poll in 2012 showed the same thing: Mr. Obama won Cuban-American voters under age 45 by 26 points and lost those over age 45 by 29 points. </s> <s> The declining significance of national security and the different waves of immigrants @-@more than half of Cuban immigrants have arrived since 1990@-@ are plausible but not definitive explanations for this. </s> <s> What is clear is that this shift has dealt a blow to Republican fortunes in Florida. </s> <s> President Obama won the state by 74,000 votes, or 0.9 of a percentage point, in 2012. </s> <s> If Cuban voters had swung a net 20 points away from Mr. Obama @-@ a showing that still would have been far better than John Kerry@-@s in 2004 @-@ he would have lost the state. </s> <s> That@-@s easily illustrated in Miami-Dade County, where Mr. Obama posted what could be called his most impressive performance in the country. </s> <s> Mr. Obama won the county by 24 points in 2012, far better than Mr. Kerry@-@s six-point victory in 2004. </s> <s> What was so impressive was that his margin of victory grew by a staggering eight percentage points over his 16-point victory in 2008, even though it was a far closer election nationally. </s> <s> There is no other county, let alone such a large one, in a battleground state where Mr. Obama made similar gains. </s> <s> Mr. Obama@-@s strength in Miami-Dade County was decisive. </s> <s> His vote margin there

</s> <s> Of course not, they lost,@-@ the Democratic strategist Donna Brazile said of 2008. </s> <s> @-@But what lessons will they apply to the future if she decides to run? </s> <s> @-@Some things have clearly changed: Those close to Mrs. Clinton now embrace a view that her gender can be more of an asset than a liability. </s> <s> But familiar hazards remain, especially the air of inevitability that seems to surround the Clinton camp, along with the lack of a broader rationale for her candidacy. </s> <s> @-@Inevitability is not a message,@-@ said Terry Shumaker, a prominent New Hampshire Democrat and former United States ambassador. </s> <s> @-@It@-@s not something you can run on,@-@ he added. </s> <s> These topics are being quietly discussed at private dinners with donors, at strategy talks hosted by an outside @-@super PAC@-@ and in casual conversation as Mrs. Clinton greets friends at holiday parties and a Clinton Foundation fund-raiser in New York. </s> <s> @-@If she runs, it will be different,@-@ said Mrs. Clinton@-@s spokesman, Nick Merrill. </s> <s> Last month, at a gathering hosted by Ready for Hillary, a super PAC intended to build grass-roots support for a Clinton candidacy, strategists explained to donors over lunch and in presentations that Mrs. Clinton would need to run in 2016 the way she did after she began to struggle in the 2008 primary season. </s> <s> By the time the delegate tallies favored Mr. Obama, Mrs. Clinton began to show a vulnerable, less scripted and entitled side. </s> <s> She adopted a message focused on lifting the middle class, and she connected with women and white working-class voters over kitchen table issues. </s> <s> She won primaries in Ohio and Pennsylvania. </s> <s> @-@I always found it remarkable that working-class women could connect to her life despite the fact that this is somebody who operated in the highest circles in America,@-@ said Geoff Garin, a pollster who succeeded Mark Penn as the campaign@-@s chief strategist in 2008. </s> <s> Mrs. Clinton is keeping a quiet schedule over the next several weeks. </s> <s> She is holding frequent meetings to listen directly to the type of strategic advice that during her last campaign was filtered through a tiny cadre of loyal but sparring advisers. </s> <s> Most of those advisers, including Mr. Penn, still have ties to the Clintons, which makes some of the more than a dozen supporters interviewed for this article wonder whether the personnel problems and infighting that plagued the last campaign could really be resolved in another one. </s> <s> Ready for Hillary, which since its inception has tried to signal that things must be done differently in 2016, counts former White House aides like Harold M. Ickes, Craig T. Smith and Ann Lewis as advisers. </s> <s> But it also includes Jeremy Bird and Mitch Stewart, Obama organizers whose presence Mr. Ickes called @-@Exhibit A of new ways of doing things. </s> <s> @-@Obama operatives like Buffy Wicks and Jim Messina have been brought on to run another pro-Clinton super PAC, Priorities USA Action. </s> <s> @-@Inner circles change over time depending on the nature of the enterprise,@-@ Mr. Ickes said. </s> <s> @-@There are always people with their noses out of joint,@-@ he added, but the Clintons @-@are good at picking people. </s> <s> @-@Super PACs are ostensibly banned from collaboration with candidates, and Ready for Hillary does not constitute Mrs. Clinton@-@s innermost circle. </s> <s> The group, run by a mix of young devotees and older loyalists, will dissolve if she declares her candidacy. </s> <s> But its efforts in the long pre-campaign period, particularly in the approach to data and outreach to young college students, are likely to influence how the official campaign would function. </s> <s> The group has also helped Mrs. Clinton keep well-meaning, but distracting, supporters at bay. </s> <s> It is a strategy that Mr. Obama adopted in 2007 to make sure that supporters felt useful and included without allowing the candidate to become overwhelmed with advice, as Mrs. Clinton did in 2008. </s> <s> Mr. Bird called the approach @-@respect, empower, include@-@ and said, @-@It@-@s a consistent challenge all campaigns have. </s> <s> @-@This is perhaps a bigger challenge for Mrs. Clinton, given that she and her husband have built an extraordinary network of friends, donors and advisers over their decades in public life, all of whom will be invested in trying to get them back to the White House. </s> <s> @-@She will be very careful to make sure there are clear lines of authority and that the people in charge are not in charge because they are old cronies, but because they@-@re the smartest people to run the campaign,@-@ said Richard Socarides, a former White House aide. </s> <s> In 2008, the smartest person on Mrs. Clinton@-@s campaign, her husband, became a liability. </s> <s> Mr. Clinton enraged black voters by comparing Mr. Obama@-@s victory in the South Carolina primary to the Rev. </s> <s> Jesse L.

democratic Cuba,@-@ he wrote. </s> <s> @-@The beneficiaries of President Obama@-@s ill-advised move will be the heinous Castro brothers who have oppressed the Cuban people for decades. </s> <s> @-@The question for Republicans is how well that sentiment resonates, most notably in Florida. </s> <s> A poll of Cuban-Americans in Miami-Dade County conducted this year by Florida International University found that 68 percent were open to the possibility of restoring diplomatic relations between the two countries, a number that rises to 88 percent among those younger than 30. </s> <s> But the Hispanic population of Florida is increasingly multidimensional, with a large number of former residents of Puerto Rico and others from Latin and South America, for whom the issue of Cuba is not paramount. </s> <s> This has been particularly true in the growing Orlando area; Mr. Obama@-@s victory in Florida in 2012 was powered in part by his sizable margins in two heavily Hispanic counties. </s> <s> Indeed, after decades of ritual stops for strong Cuban coffee on Calle Ocho in Little Havana in Miami, candidates are spending more time in the Puerto Rican enclaves in and around Orlando. </s> <s> Even those results have not translated into a shift among most Republicans. </s> <s> @-@If you@-@re from Florida, the politics may have shifted, but not enough to make it worthwhile to change your

skepticism, in no small part because he has staked out positions at odds with the Republican Party@-@s conservative base. </s> <s> Mr. Bush@-@s positions on immigration and education are certainly challenges, but probably overrated ones. </s> <s> Tone and message, not the specifics of his policy agenda, will probably determine whether he can strike the balance necessary to appeal to the party@-@s donors without losing too much ground among staunch conservatives. </s> <s> This is not to say that Mr. Bush, a former Florida governor, is close to being in touch with the conservative base on immigration reform and education policy. </s> <s> Both issues are probably potent enough to hurt his chances. </s> <s> But he is no iconoclast, not even by the standards of recent Republican nominees, who have overcome greater heresies. </s> <s> John McCain won the Republican nomination in 2008 by running as a @-@maverick. </s> <s> @-@ In the years before his campaign, he co-sponsored an immigration reform bill and a plan to regulate carbon emissions. </s> <s> He bashed @-@extremists on the right@-@ in a previous presidential race. </s> <s> Four years later, Mitt Romney won the nomination even though he had enacted a health care plan that served as the model for the Affordable Care Act. </s> <s> He had supported a long list of liberal positions in his various runs for statewide office in Massachusetts. </s> <s> Heading into this year@-@s contest, Chris Christie, another rival for the support of mainline, establishment-friendly Republicans, has committed equal or perhaps graver blasphemies on gun control and immigration. </s> <s> Mr. Bush may indeed struggle to win Iowa, which leads the Republican nomination process. </s> <s> But he could seriously compete there, unlike Mr. McCain in 2008. </s> <s> The Iowa caucuses are dominated by evangelical voters more than Tea Party voters. </s> <s> They select cultural conservatives, like Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum. </s> <s> Mr. Bush has solid credentials on cultural issues, so there@-@s no reason to dismiss his chances there at the outset, even if he@-@s unlikely to be the candidate of religious activists. </s> <s> Even Mr. Romney, a Mormon who once supported abortion rights, came within 35 votes of winning the Iowa caucuses in 2012. </s> <s> The real challenge for Mr. Bush is negotiating the competing pressures of the so-called invisible primaries and the actual ones. </s> <s> The invisible primary is the competition for the support of party officials and donors with the influence and money necessary to propel a candidate toward the party@-@s nomination. </s> <s> A candidate who wins the invisible primary decisively almost always goes on to win the nomination. </s> <s> Mr. Bush@-@s biggest asset is the extent to which he seems to appeal to the fairly moderate business-oriented and mainline officials and donors who have outsize influence in the invisible primary. </s> <s> My colleague Nicholas Confessore reported that Mr. Bush was among three candidates whom donors might try to unify behind in the initial stages of the primary. </s> <s> Mr. Bush@-@s early foray into the field on Tuesday may be an attempt to prevent those donors from consolidating around a different candidate, or even a pre-emptive show of strength to dissuade another candidate, like Mr. Romney, from running to win the same donors. </s> <s> The catch, of course, is that the source of Mr. Bush@-@s appeal among the Republican donor class is a message and tone that often seems close to attacking conservatives as ideologues. </s> <s> Mr. Bush suggested that Ronald Reagan would @-@have a hard time@-@ in today@-@s Republican Party, and said the party sounded as if it didn@-@t allow for disagreement among its members. </s> <s> A candidate can get away with a couple of moderate positions; it@-@s a lot harder to run against the party@-@s base, like Jon Huntsman in 2012. </s> <s> It would be one thing if Mr. Bush@-@s push against the base were heard only at dinner parties on the Upper East Side or in Alexandria, Va., or if Mr. Bush were planning to move a bit toward the right during the primary season. </s> <s> But it doesn@-@t seem as if either will be true. </s> <s> Another colleague, Jonathan Martin, wrote last week that Mr. Bush didn@-@t want to alter his @-@persona to satisfy his party@-@s hard-liners@-@ if he runs. </s> <s> This @-@persona,@-@ perhaps along with his association with his brother@-@s often activist view of government, is probably creating a bigger problem for Mr. Bush on his right flank than one might guess based on his policies alone. </s> <s> A Monmouth University poll, published on Tuesday, showed that Mr. Bush held a tepid 39 percent favorability rating among Tea Party supporters, with 38 percent unfavorable @-@ worse than any other major potential nominee except for Chris Christie. </s> <s> He held a better though hardly impressive plus-15 rating among non-Tea Party Republicans. </s> <s> Similarly, a McClatchy@-@Marist poll showed Mr. Bush with just 8 percent of the vote among Tea Party supporters, enough for fifth place, compared with 21 percent among non-Tea Party supporters @-@among whom he led@-@. </s> <s> Mr. Bush could still win even if Tea Party supporters opposed him by a wide margin. </s> <s> Mr. Romney managed to steer down the same narrow path to victory in 2012. </s> <s> It@-@s a path that starts by consolidating the establishment wing of the party in the invisible primary. </s> <s> It ends by winning a protracted fight against an underfunded conservative opponent who can@-@t break through in the delegate-rich blue states that are often needed to win the party@-@s nomination, even though the party struggles to win them in presidential elections. </s> <s> It is an arduous path to victory. </s> <s> But candidates with the favor of the establishment have won nearly every recent nominating contest for a reason: It brings big advantages. </s> <s> And the Republican establishment doesn@-@t appear to have too many other choices. </s> <s> If top G. O. P. donors are indeed choosing between Mr. Bush, Mr. Christie and Mr. Romney, they might not have a better option than Mr. Bush. </s> <s> But Mr. Bush is not a particularly strong candidate either. </s> <s> He may have friends in the donor class, but he hasn@-@t run for office in a decade, and he enters with no base of support among the G. O.

Spies, the former governor set up an organizational vehicle that would let him employ staff and raise the legal maximum amount of money from donors for as long as he considered his decision. </s> <s> Mr. Bush could then return to those same contributors for additional money if he ultimately established a full-blown campaign committee. </s> <s> The question that looms over@-@yet another Bush

Zemel first visited Israel fresh off his bar mitzvah, in 1966. </s> <s> A bookish Jewish kid from Chicago, Zemel had a love for Israel inherited from his grandfather, Rabbi Solomon Goldman, a friend of Albert Einstein@-@s who was president from 1938 to 1940 of the then left-leaning Zionist Organization of America. </s> <s> With the other members of his Jewish education group, the 13-year-old Zemel spent two weeks in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Haifa. </s> <s> He lunched in cafeterias with the kibbutzniks he idolized, ate frozen treats on the beach and climbed a lookout tower, peering into Jerusalem@-@s still forbidden Old City. </s> <s> A year later, Zemel was ecstatic when Israeli forces captured everything he had surveyed and beyond, including the Temple Mount, the West Bank and Gaza, in the Six-Day War with Egypt, Syria and Jordan. </s> <s> Over the decades, as Israel matured and began to wrestle with the occupation, Zemel did, too. </s> <s> He visited Israel again and again, as a college student, a rabbinical student and an assistant rabbi in Minnesota. </s> <s> In 1983, Zemel became the head rabbi of Temple Micah, in the Northwest section of Washington. </s> <s> In the constellation of liberal American synagogues, there are a handful that stand out for their political engagement and the influence of their members @-@ Leo Baeck Temple in Los Angeles, Congregation Beth Elohim in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and KAM Isaiah Israel on Barack Obama@-@s old block in Chicago. </s> <s> But none have more connections to Capitol Hill. </s> <s> In the fall, Zemel, a contemplative 62-year-old with horn-rimmed glasses, a bushy mustache and a bald dome from which his skullcap incessantly slips, stood before his congregation in a state of unrest. </s> <s> It was the start of the Jewish New Year, and he had decided to express his anguish over Israel in the form of a sermon about the direction his beloved country had taken. </s> <s> All summer, during the war in Gaza, Zemel and many of the members of his progressive congregation had been racked with worry. </s> <s> In his book-lined office, decorated with an Israeli flag and a poster of Yoda holding a Hebrew bible, emails from congregants had been regularly popping up on Zemel@-@s computer screen, railing about Israelis @-@killing children. </s> <s> @-@ Zemel sat with congregants as they wept on his couch. </s> <s> The entire year 5774, in fact, was a trying one for Zemel and other liberal Zionists, who increasingly find themselves torn between their liberalism and Zionism and stranded in the disappearing middle between the extremes of a polarized American Jewish community. </s> <s> Micah@-@s liberal Zionists remained wedded to a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians and estranged from the policies of a right-wing Israeli government, along with the reflexive Israel-can-do-no-wrong sentiment on Capitol Hill. </s> <s> But they also felt alienated by Jewish groups to their left, some of which chanted, @-@Stop the murder, stop the hate, Israel is a racist state. </s> <s> @-@Zemel, fighting a nagging cold, looked out at the robust crowd on Rosh Hashana. </s> <s> He knew that the people gathered before him @-@ and the people they knew @-@ could help determine United States policy toward Israel. </s> <s> Some of them even had a direct line to Hillary Clinton, the early favorite to be the Democrats@-@ nominee for president in 2016. </s> <s> Sara Ehrman, who is 95 and a veteran of Jewish-American politics, was a mentor to Clinton; she sat next to Maria Echaveste, a former official in Bill Clinton@-@s administration and a convert to Judaism whom President Obama nominated to become ambassador to Mexico. </s> <s> Al From, an architect of the Democratic resurgence of the 1990s and adviser to Bill Clinton, sat across the aisle. </s> <s> Arrayed around them sat newspaper, magazine and television journalists in a congregation that included David Gregory, a former host of @-@Meet the Press@-@; Jake Tapper, a CNN anchor; and Dana Bash, a Washington correspondent for CNN and the former wife of Jeremy Bash, who was a national-security official in the Obama administration. </s> <s> Another member of the congregation is Alan Cooperman, director of religion research at the Pew Research Center, which a year before published a landmark portrait of Jewish Americans that showed, among other things, that less than a third of young Jews said @-@caring about Israel@-@ was essential to their Jewish identity. </s> <s> Zemel adjusted his skullcap. </s> <s> @-@Tonight we celebrate the creation of the world,@-@ he said. </s> <s> @-@But in this season we also take a look at ourselves: We acknowledge our past, our errors, who we are. </s> <s> What better time to look in the same way at the only Jewish country in the world? </s> <s> The events of this summer actually only strengthened my decision to speak about Israel and American Jewry@-@s ongoing and evolving relationship with that mystifying, infuriating yet enchanting place. </s> <s> @-@As the sermon progressed, Zemel became more impassioned. </s> <s> He recounted the story of the reprisal murder in July of a Palestinian teenager from East Jerusalem by Israeli extremists. </s> <s> @-@I am so ashamed,@-@ he shouted. </s> <s> He bemoaned the growing ultranationalism in Israel by saying it had @-@dragged through the mud@-@ what he called @-@the greatest ethical tradition in history. </s> <s> @-@ Heads nodded in the pews. </s> <s> @-@In many segments of American Jewry,@-@ Zemel said, @-@one is free to disagree with the president of the United States, but the prime minister of Israel is sacrosanct. </s> <s> How patently absurd! </s> <s> @-@ Zemel@-@s criticism of the current Israeli government pivoted to a discussion of how the Holocaust and that summer@-@s flare-ups of anti-Semitism in Europe reminded them all that Israel was existentially necessary. </s> <s> @-@We must love Israel even harder,@-@ he concluded, quoting from the Israeli national anthem. </s> <s> @-@Od lo avda tikvateinu. </s> <s> We have not yet lost our hope. </s> <s> @-@For Zemel and his faithfully Democratic congregation, that hope and anxiety has come to rest most squarely on Hillary Clinton. </s> <s> This has happened at the same time that Clinton has staked out a firmly hawkish, pro-Israel position on Gaza and Israeli security. </s> <s> In August, many liberals were discouraged after reading a Clinton interview with Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic. </s> <s> In it, she struck a tone on Israel that was markedly more hard-line than that of the Obama administration, generally avoiding empathy with Palestinian losses and asserting, @-@If I were the prime minister of Israel, you@-@re damn right I would expect to have control over security@-@ on the West Bank. </s> <s> Asked about her tough talk, liberal Zionists tend to blame the requirements of American presidential-campaign politics. </s> <s> A vast majority of Jews care far more about social issues and the economy than they do about the issue of Israel and will always vote for the Democratic candidate. </s> <s> @-@Democrats who are Jewish will turn out in droves in support of her,@-@ Haim Saban, a media mogul and major Clinton-campaign financier told me. </s> <s> And the Jewish donors? </s> <s> @-@Without a doubt. </s> <s> @-@But Clinton knows that there is a wealthy and influential sliver of more-moderate Democratic Jews for whom Israel is a priority. </s> <s> They are less conservative than the G. O. P.@-@s top Jewish donors, like Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino owner, but feel protective enough of Israel that they could plausibly support a Republican if they sensed anything less than complete support from a Democrat. </s> <s> The political arithmetic for Clinton is easy @-@ knowing you can take the larger liberal Jewish vote for granted, you support Israel@-@s right-wing government to keep moderates from bolting. </s> <s> The political quandary for liberal Zionists is that, as part of the Jewish majority that will vote for Clinton regardless, they aren@-@t in a great position to make demands and are reduced to hoping that Clinton secretly agonizes over the issue as much as they do. </s> <s> Saban, the major Clinton-campaign financier, told me that Clinton was pained by the consequences of Israel@-@s actions, just not publicly. </s> <s> @-@I can tell you that privately she has expressed empathy for the Palestinians,@-@ he told me. </s> <s> @-@She has. </s> <s> @-@ Victor Kovner, a Democratic bundler who has a Chuck Close painting of Hillary Clinton hanging in his New York office, assures fellow liberal Jews that Clinton is on their side. </s> <s> @-@She is running for president, this isn@-@t true-self time,@-@ he said. </s> <s> He suggested that Bill Clinton had demonstrated a much more nuanced view. </s> <s> But other Clinton supporters have no patience for hand-wringing liberal Zionists, especially because there is little daylight between them and Clinton on actual policy. </s> <s> @-@What do they want her to do? </s> <s> @-@ said Ann Lewis, a senior adviser on Clinton@-@s 2008 presidential campaign who is involved with Jewish issues. </s> <s> The standard line for Hillary Clinton, who declined to be interviewed for this article, is that she has been a consistent voice for Israel and for peace over the last quarter-century. </s> <s> But other Clinton intimates, including those in Temple Micah, say they have watched her position shift by degrees over the decades. </s> <s> Ehrman, for one, recalled an early iteration of Hillary Clinton as a promising liberal voice on Israel. </s> <s> Ehrman first met Clinton during George McGovern@-@s 1972 presidential campaign in Texas. </s> <s> Back in Washington, Ehrman hosted Clinton, who had landed a job on the Watergate committee, in her apartment for a year, and the two became close. </s> <s> Ehrman later drove Clinton to Fayetteville, Ark., telling her all the way that she was making a mistake by giving up a promising career to marry the @-@country lawyer@-@ Bill Clinton. </s> <s> In the early 1980s, Ehrman became political-education director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee @-@ or Aipac @-@ the country@-@s most potent pro-Israel lobbying group. </s> <s> When the Clintons came to Washington as president and first lady, Ehrman became deputy political director of the Democratic National Committee. </s> <s> @-@I did all the Jewish stuff around the White House,@-@ Ehrman said. </s> <s> That work culminated in organizing the Oslo Accords ceremony, at which Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands with the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat on the south lawn of the White House, sealing an agreement between Jews and Palestinians to end their conflict. </s> <s> On the morning of the signing ceremony, Hillary Clinton called Ehrman with a special reward. </s> <s> @-@I want you to stand at the front door of the diplomatic entrance, the main entrance, and I want you to see them coming in,@-@ Ehrman recalled her saying. </s> <s> The event was a high point of liberal Zionism@-@s harmony with Washington politics. </s> <s> @-@It was totally, totally amazing,@-@ said Zemel, who also attended the event. </s> <s> Clinton@-@s interest in the issue did not end there. </s> <s> In May 1998, speaking via satellite to young Arabs and Israelis gathered in Switzerland for a conference, she became one of the first people associated with the Clinton administration to call for a two-state solution. </s> <s> @-@I think that it will be in the long-term interest of the Middle East for Palestine to be a state,@-@ she said, adding that @-@the territory that the Palestinians currently inhabit, and whatever additional territory they will obtain through the peace negotiations,@-@ should be considered @-@a functioning modern state. </s> <s> @-@The White House, seemingly uncomfortable with her statement, clarified that she was expressing a personal view. </s> <s> Her willingness to embrace the Palestinians soon caused another problem. </s> <s> In 1999, Ehrman accompanied Hillary Clinton on a trip to Ramallah, during which Clinton listened to Suha Arafat, the wife of the Palestinian Authority leader Yasir Arafat, deliver a speech in Arabic accusing the Israeli government of gassing Palestinian women and children. </s> <s> At the conclusion of the remarks, Clinton embraced Suha Arafat and offered a customary peck on the cheek. </s> <s> The moment news of the kiss hit the wires, a high-ranking Clinton administration official placed an angry call to the cellphone of Rob Malley, a Middle East adviser to the president, who was traveling with the first lady, demanding that he fix the problem. </s> <s> But the damage to Hillary Clinton was done. </s> <s> The next day, some New York Jewish leaders seized on the incident to discredit Hillary Clinton@-@s candidacy for the United States Senate, which was unofficially well underway. </s> <s> The New York Post ran a front-page headline reading @-@Shame on Hillary. </s> <s> @-@ It was around this time that she enrolled in political Hebrew School. </s> <s> Under the tutelage of the senior New York senator, Chuck Schumer, she became extremely adept at winning the trust of audiences who held an absolute pro-Israel position. </s> <s> Schumer did, however, need to assure attendees at one campaign fund-raiser that @-@she will look to me to see how to vote@-@ on Jewish issues. </s> <s> Clinton was elected to the Senate in 2000 and struck a tone that was in sync with the Bush administration, which had aligned itself with the Israeli right. </s> <s> In 2007, she went further than the administration when she released a position paper calling for @-@an undivided Jerusalem@-@ as the capital of Israel. </s> <s> In 2008, as a presidential candidate, she warned Tehran that America would @-@totally obliterate@-@ Iran if it attacked Israel. </s> <s> By this time, Clinton was an Aipac favorite, and Aipac had changed from the time that Ehrman had worked there. </s> <s> Founded in 1954 to strengthen the U. S.-Israel relationship regardless of political ideology, the lobby has become increasingly conservative in its politics and Orthodox in its membership, while developing an unparalleled network of donors around the country. </s> <s> Its financial power, demonstrated at annual megaconferences that bring together presidential candidates and congressional power brokers, has translated into legislative might. </s> <s> Aipac-backed bills @-@ on, for example, support for the Israeli military or sanctions against Iran @-@ usually pass unanimously in Congress. </s> <s> Many liberal Jews, alienated by Aipac over the years, were encouraged when Barack Obama ran against Clinton in the 2008 presidential primary. </s> <s> They appreciated that he took a more nuanced position when it came to supporting Israel, one that better reflected the political debate within Israel and among American Jews. </s> <s> They saw him as the rare presidential candidate who spoke their language and who seemed willing to push Israel toward peace. </s> <s> They expressed relief when he said that you could be committed to Israel while criticizing the policies of the right-wing government. </s> <s> @-@I think there is a strain within the pro-Israel community that says unless you adopt an unwavering pro-Likud approach to Israel that you@-@re opposed to Israel, that you@-@re anti-Israel,@-@ he said. </s> <s> @-@And that can@-@t be the measure of our friendship with Israel. </s> <s> @-@Once elected, Obama seemed to understand that he needed someone to lend him credibility with the Israeli government and its American defenders, a tough friend of Israel who could muscle the country away from settlements and toward a peace agreement. </s> <s> An aide to Obama called Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish American Organizations, and asked him to call Hillary Clinton to see if she would be @-@agreeable@-@ to being named secretary of state. </s> <s> Early in her tenure as secretary, she was harshly critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the country@-@s increasingly conservative culture, surprising and appalling Aipac and many of her supporters in New York. </s> <s> She excoriated Israel@-@s settlement growth and the @-@antidemocratic@-@ tendencies of its right wing and also the practice, in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, of gender discrimination @-@reminiscent of Rosa Parks. </s> <s> @-@As Clinton pressured Israel to make peace from the State Department, the Obama administration looked to J Street, a new and progressive Jewish lobby, to give members of Congress financial backing and credibility on Israel so that they could support the president without fear of being cash-starved by Aipac or called anti-Israel. </s> <s> J Street boasts of helping Obama defeat an Aipac-backed bill that would have scuttled the administration@-@s Iran nuclear talks. </s> <s> For the most part, though, unquestioning support for Israel has remained dominant in Washington. </s> <s> Even before she left the administration, Clinton essentially shed any pretense that she was still playing the role of impartial arbiter. </s> <s> As Israel flouted her own government@-@s demand that it not build more settlements in East Jerusalem, Clinton spoke so effusively about Netanyahu at a December 2012 conference that political observers considered the speech tantamount to a presidential announcement. </s> <s> Since then, Clinton has further distanced herself from her job as secretary of state, making light of her role as Netanyahu@-@s disciplinarian for Obama and calling herself the president@-@s @-@designated yeller. </s> <s> @-@This explanation of Clinton@-@s earlier rebukes of Israel is already gospel among her pro-Israel supporters. </s> <s> Lewis, a backer of the independent super PAC Ready for Hillary, told me that Clinton @-@was not in the lead on making policy. </s> <s> @-@Clinton@-@s return to campaign form has left liberal Zionists with little choice other than rationalization. </s> <s> @-@I sense that the people who advise Hillary Clinton on Jewish politics came of age in an era when the rules of the game were different,@-@ Jeremy Ben-Ami, the founder and president of J Street, told me, suggesting that the time of reflexive support for Israel, regardless of their government@-@s policies, had ended. </s> <s> When I asked if he could persuade Clinton that such a position was no longer tenable, he answered, not so convincingly, @-@We definitely need to try. </s> <s> @-@Other liberal Zionists are hoping that Bill Clinton could be a more sympathetic voice within a Clinton White House. </s> <s> After Zemel@-@s Rosh Hashana sermon, in which he talked about the need for @-@Jewish genius@-@ to solve the problem in Israel, Al From told me, @-@Bill Clinton has this little bit of genius. </s> <s> @-@Zemel concurred. </s> <s> @-@I want Hillary,@-@ he said. </s> <s> @-@So I can get a second round with Bill. </s> <s> @-@Over the summer and fall, many of Micah@-@s congregants and other influential liberal Zionists around Washington aired their discomfort with Clinton on Facebook and in op-ed pages and journals. </s> <s> But they were made even more uneasy by the specter of an increasingly loud Jewish left wing that is openly hostile to Israel and advocates punishing it economically. </s> <s> At a Shabbat service in August, Zemel@-@s 22-year-old daughter, Ronit, a senior at Macalester College in St. Paul, sat in the front row of Micah@-@s sanctuary. </s> <s> She listened to her father say, @-@What is needed to make peace between the peoples of these two lands is probably more than humans can summon,@-@ which is from @-@My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel,@-@ a history of the country@-@s ethical struggle since its independence, by Ari Shavit, a columnist for the left-leaning Israeli paper Haaretz. </s> <s> In a few days Zemel@-@s daughter would head back to school, where she had served as co-chairwoman of the student wing of J Street, known as J Street U. </s> <s> The idea of going back to campus, she told me, gave her @-@the

that a majority of adults oppose his plan. </s> <s> But as is the case on many issues, the politics of immigration reform are not simply about the issue@-@s popularity in national public opinion polls. </s> <s> They are also about intensity and coalitions: Who are the voters that really care about the issue, and how much do they matter? </s> <s> On immigration, the answer is fairly clear. </s> <s> Hispanic voters care a lot, and matter a lot. </s> <s> A Pew Research poll conducted last week showed that 81 percent of Hispanics supported the immigration action, as did 64 percent in a Gallup poll conducted between Nov. 24 and Dec. 8. </s> <s> That large majorities of Hispanic adults support Mr. Obama@-@s decision isn@-@t at all surprising. </s> <s> What is more telling is the extent to which Mr. Obama@-@s approval rating among Hispanic voters seems to have improved. </s> <s> Both Pew Research and Gallup show Mr. Obama@-@s approval rating rising into the mid-60s, up from around 50 percent earlier in November. </s> <s> The survey samples are not huge, but they are not small either @-@ probably a combined 600 respondents @-@ and they show a decisive, similar and appropriately timed movement toward Mr. Obama. </s> <s> There may not be a better example of a domestic policy change leading to a double-digit increase in a president@-@s approval rating among the targeted demographic group. </s> <s> Killing Osama bin Laden didn@-@t boost Mr. Obama@-@s approval rating by even 10 points among the public at large. </s> <s> To a certain extent, it was easy for Mr. Obama to make big gains among Hispanics. </s> <s> He had a lot of opportunities. </s> <s> The president won 71 percent of Hispanic voters in 2012, but since then his approval rating among them had sunk about 20 points, so there was room for improvement. </s> <s> These Democratic-leaning voters are presumably the easiest for Mr. Obama to win back. </s> <s> Nonetheless the gain is extremely impressive. </s> <s> By signing a piece of paper and taking a trip to Las Vegas, Mr. Obama boosted his rating among Hispanics, who make up 14 percent of the adult population, by around 15 points. </s> <s> He was not assisted by weeks of national media attention @-@ the racial unrest in Ferguson, Mo., interceded soon after the announcement. </s> <s> There was no prolonged national campaign to hammer the message home and certainly no television advertisements. </s> <s> The Republicans didn@-@t help him out by shutting down the government, as some thought they might. </s> <s> If there had been a shutdown this month, it would have been because of a dispute over financial reform, not immigration reform. </s> <s> Few would have predicted that three weeks ago. </s> <s> And at the same time, there was not much evidence that the decision hurt Mr. Obama much among non-Hispanic voters. </s> <s> Now, it was hard for immigration to visibly damage Mr. Obama among non-Hispanic voters for the exact opposite reason that the issue helped him among Hispanic voters: His approval ratings among non-Hispanics were so low that policies would need to be particularly unpopular to drive them further down. </s> <s> But it is doubtful that it hurt Mr. Obama much among the voters who matter most to his party @-@ the Democratic-leaning or persuadable voters who supported or considered supporting him in 2012, but are now disillusioned by his performance. </s> <s> Most of the people who strongly opposed Mr. Obama@-@s decision were probably Republican base voters. </s> <s> The balance of public polling data suggests that most persuadable voters are fairly sympathetic to Democratic views on immigration reform, even if they opposed Mr. Obama@-@s action. </s> <s> Even if many persuadable voters were outraged, the Republicans did not vigorously press their case. </s> <s> The issue will probably fade from memory, if it hasn@-@t already. </s> <s> Mr. Obama@-@s decision will eventually fade from the minds of Hispanic voters as well. </s> <s> But the longevity of the bump is probably less significant than its size and the fact that it happened. </s> <s> It may be a sign that Democratic-leaning voters who currently disapprove of Mr. Obama@-@s performance will come flocking back to the Democrats the moment the 2016 campaign arouses their partisanship. </s> <s> It is a sign that although these voters may be dissatisfied with Mr. Obama@-@s performance, they remain quite receptive to Democratic messages on the issues that brought them to the party in the first place. </s> <s> In a way, we@-@ve been here before. </s> <s> In the fall of 2011, after the debt ceiling debacle, Mr. Obama@-@s approval rating slipped to about the point where it is today. </s> <s> And his approval rating among Hispanic voters dropped to about where it was before his immigration decision. </s> <s> Yet his overall approval rating would rise to 50 percent by Election Day, just a year later. </s> <s> His 71 percent showing among Hispanic voters, according to the exit polls, was even more than he won in 2008. </s> <s> The voters who traditionally lean Democratic, at least outside the South and coal country, returned to his side. </s> <s> The Obama campaign employed a diverse suite of messages to appeal to every facet of the Democratic coalition: contraception and same-sex marriage for young, secular and well-educated voters; Mitt Romney@-@s time at Bain Capital and the auto bailout for working-class voters; and, yes, deferred action for undocumented minors to appeal to Hispanic voters. </s> <s> Whether the next Democrat will reassemble the coalition that re-elected Mr. Obama remains to be seen. </s> <s> That said, Mr. Obama@-@s rebound among Hispanic voters may be a sign that the

of the 2012 presidential contest: that Mr. Romney@-@s campaign was tightly scripted online, while President Obama@-@s campaign published creative graphics and online reports featuring interviews with volunteers. </s> <s> Mr. Kreiss did find that the Romney campaign exercised tighter control over the social media efforts of individual staff members, while their counterparts working for the Obama campaign had more autonomy to post original content. </s> <s> @-@An example being a tweet, retweeted 58,000 times, in response to Clint Eastwood@-@s monologue with an empty chair at the Republican

weren@-@t the most important aspect of how they used Twitter, Mr. Kreiss@-@s paper shows. </s> <s> Both campaigns were alike in using Twitter as an agenda-setting tool, particularly as @-@a vehicle for influencing the professional media,@-@ Mr. Kreiss writes. </s> <s> An impressive number of retweets may make for good copy, but campaigns are eager to ensure that a smaller, more influential audience is the main target of their communications. </s> <s> Teddy Goff, the Obama campaign@-@s digital director, told Mr. Kreiss that @-@most likely not one thing we did on Twitter persuaded any voter or even necessarily reached any undecided voter. </s> <s> @-@ Instead, the campaign @-@spent a lot of time thinking about how we could sort of manipulate the sort of national dialogue, the dialogue around politics. </s> <s> @-@Similarly, people on Mr. Romney@-@s campaign created a sophisticated Twitter outreach during the presidential debates, and credited their social media efforts for helping to shape the media interpretation of the first debate, which many observers saw as a victory for Mr. Romney. </s> <s> The Obama team changed its Twitter approach for the second debate, according to Mr. Kreiss: @-@Learning from the first debate, where Obama@-@s digital team did not do extensive planning in advance, staffers entered the second debate with a more defined plan and scripted approach to tweets.@-@Mr. </s> <s> Kreiss@-@s research is based on interviews with digital staff members in both campaigns, and he concludes that digital teams within campaigns have reduced

<s> So he is offering an alternative model for 21st-century presidential success. </s> <s> It does not hinge on job approval ratings. </s> <s> As Mr. Obama@-@s weak poll numbers make clear, he has

Edwards III, a Texas A@-@M professor who edits Presidential Studies Quarterly, wrote last year that critics of Washington dysfunction @-@take their frustrations out on the president, declaring that he should more effectively move the public and Congress to support his initiatives. </s> <s> There is little prospect for success in these endeavors, however. </s> <s> @-@Presidents, Mr. Edwards noted, @-@cannot create opportunities for change. </s> <s> Instead, effective presidents recognize and exploit opportunities that exist in their environments.@-@Mr. </s> <s> Edwards@-@s view rests on his conclusion, after poring over data since the advent of political polling, that the persuasive power of the bully pulpit has always been @-@a myth. </s> <s> @-@ Public approval tends to drift away from any president@-@s views over time. </s> <s> Lacking the power to shift public opinion, presidents hold scant leverage over members of Congress not already inclined to support them, Mr. Edwards said in an interview. </s> <s> Moreover, they now have fewer means of persuasion. </s> <s> When President Lyndon Johnson pursued the Great Society, he could woo moderate Republicans on the basis of ideology and conservative Democrats in the name of partisan unity. </s> <s> In today@-@s polarized system, lawmakers have grown increasingly uniform in opposition to a president from the other major party. </s> <s> And levers that had been used to broker compromise, like pending earmarks for pet projects, have mostly been eliminated. </s> <s> From the outset of Mr. Obama@-@s presidency, Mr. Edwards argued, aspirations for a post-partisan transformation in Washington were unattainable. </s> <s> But he says Mr. Obama@-@s advancement of key domestic and foreign policy goals @-@makes him a consequential president@-@ @-@ for good or ill. </s> <s> Given partisan and ideological divisions, roughly half the country would almost invariably choose @-@ill.@-@ The last president to muffle the trend toward increasing polarization was George Bush. </s> <s> Not coincidentally, he failed to win re-election. </s> <s> Since then, assessments of the Oval Office occupant have grown increasingly divided by partisan affiliation. </s> <s> In an NBC News@-@Wall Street Journal poll last month, 77 percent of Democrats approved of Mr. Obama@-@s job performance; only 8 percent of Republicans did. </s> <s> That ensures continued rancor over the health care law, Mr. Obama@-@s approach to business regulations and his foreign policy, particularly whether his commitment to ending George W. Bush-era military campaigns blinded him to new emerging threats from the Islamic State and other foes. </s> <s> On issues like immigration, Democrats@-@ dependence on nonwhite voters and Republicans@-@ reliance on big majorities of whites add a racial charge to the debate. </s> <s> This landscape, except in extreme circumstances, does not offer the emotional balm of consensus about a president@-@s performance. </s> <s> Unilateral White House action, even if it furthers a president@-@s goals, cannot provide as durable a basis for national policy as law enacted with at least some support from both Republicans and Democrats. </s> <s> That is one reason the president@-@s health care law, which passed with only Democratic votes, remains unpopular. </s> <s> @-@I don@-@t define success as reversible executive orders,@-@ said William A.

Hunt @-@ Bloomberg ViewWASHINGTON @-@ The furor over President Obama@-@s executive action shielding millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation poses hazards for him, including legislative complications, a possible legal challenge and a public backlash. </s> <s> The risks for Republicans are greater, threatening to create schisms among the party@-@s members of Congress next year, spilling over to the 2016 presidential contest and perhaps costing them votes. </s> <s> The political assessment is clear from the reaction since Mr. Obama announced his plan last month: Most Democrats back the move, and they relish the anger from Republican constituencies, from the anti-immigration right to more moderate supporters of reform who resent that the president has put them on the defensive. </s> <s> Senator Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John A. Boehner, the Republican leaders in Congress, have a strategy to minimize the fallout: offer irrelevant resolutions condemning the president, cite court challenges to focus on the legal question rather than the substantive one and nick at financing for the president@-@s initiative. </s> <s> Although it will cause tension with the anti-immigration bloc, this approach is likely to succeed in the current lame-duck session. </s> <s> But the issue will keep coming back. </s> <s> That@-@s because much of the Republican base is anti-immigration and would like to deport most of the 11.5 million immigrants who are in the United States illegally. </s> <s> That was evident in the past two presidential primary cycles, when Mitt Romney, once sympathetic to an immigration overhaul, responded to rank-and-file pressure and flipped. </s> <s> He attacked Gov. </s> <s> Rick Perry of Texas and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich as soft on immigration. </s> <s> It also was evident this year when Mr. Boehner laid out a plan that would result in House passage of a comprehensive bill. </s> <s> In March, he told donors he was @-@hellbent@-@ on getting it done. </s> <s> People who know the speaker say he was serious and sincere. </s> <s> The reaction from the grass-roots level, in the House caucuses and nationwide, was vehement, even threatening Mr. Boehner@-@s speakership. </s> <s> He had to back down. </s> <s> And it was evident a week ago when Tom Cotton, the Republican senator-elect from Arkansas and a rising star in conservative circles, linked the immigration issue with terrorism. </s> <s> @-@We know these drug cartels in Mexico are focused primarily on power and profit,@-@ he said on the NBC News program @-@Meet the Press,@-@ raising the specter of collusion between Hezbollah @-@ the Iranian-supported Shiite militant movement in Lebanon @-@ and drug traffickers. </s> <s> He didn@-@t offer any evidence of a Hezbollah presence in Mexico. </s> <s> Since these conservative opponents lack the votes to overcome an Obama veto, Mr. McConnell and Mr. Boehner will have to head off moves to shut down the government or even start impeachment proceedings. </s> <s> The midterm elections have strengthened the speaker@-@s position compared with a year ago, but the grass-roots passion hasn@-@t lessened. </s> <s> This assures that immigration will be an issue in the 2016 Republican presidential race. </s> <s> Some potential candidates @-@ like former Gov. </s> <s> Jeb Bush of Florida @-@the Bush family has long advocated an immigration overhaul@-@ and Gov. </s> <s> Chris Christie of New Jersey @-@who has done well with Hispanic voters@-@ @-@ would like to moderate the tone of the debate. </s> <s> Hispanics and Asian-Americans are important and growing forces in battleground states like Colorado, Virginia and Florida. </s> <s> But as demonstrated by Mr. Romney @-@ who was beaten 71 percent to 27 percent among Hispanics and did almost as poorly with Asian-Americans @-@ a Republican candidate has to pass a threshold of acceptability on immigration to be able to go on to compete on other issues. </s> <s> The first debate in the presidential primary race is almost certain to feature this question: As president, would you repeal Mr. Obama@-@s executive action and his earlier move that gave temporary legal status to many immigrants who were brought to the United States as children? </s> <s> That then will become a litmus test for much of the base and also prevent congressional Republicans from the most effective antidote to Mr. Obama@-@s action: passing a comprehensive and credible bill of their own. </s> <s> Frank BruniBy Frank BruniNOVEMBER 2016 is still a long way off, but it@-@s hard to imagine that the presidential campaign will provide

the Democratic primaries. </s> <s> There are images of construction work, a welder, a pickup truck, a tractor, a big red barn, cows. </s> <s> It@-@s the unveiling of Hard-Hat Hillary. </s> <s> Rodeo Hillary. </s> <s> Hillary, Patron Saint of the Prairie. </s> <s> But it positions her first and foremost as all woman. </s> <s> The references are incessant. </s> <s> The chorus goes like this: @-@Thinking about one great lady like the women in my life. </s> <s> She@-@s a mother, a daughter and through it all, she@-@s a loving wife. </s> <s> @-@A man with a sledgehammer shatters a panel of

The video wasn@-@t produced by Clinton or her aides. </s> <s> But the people who did put it together clearly followed the cues that they felt they were getting, and they read her intentions right. </s> <s> If she runs, she@-@ll do so with more focus on her gender and a greater emphasis on making history than she did in 2008. </s> <s> And that@-@ll be the smart move, because her gender is precisely what offsets certain of her weaknesses as a candidate. </s> <s> To double down on the double X may be her best way to mitigate several otherwise big vulnerabilities. </s> <s> Back in 2008,

appearing at ease with it,@-@ wrote Anne Kornblut of The Washington Post in her 2009 book about that race, @-@Notes From the Cracked Ceiling. </s> <s> @-@She observed that some of Clinton@-@s key

@-@When Obama won the Iowa caucuses, everybody wrote and talked about it as historic,@-@ Kornblut told me last week. </s> <s> @-@But Jesse Jackson had won primaries. </s> <s> When Hillary Clinton won New Hampshire, it@-@was historic. </s> <s> But the coverage@-@was, @-@Hillary made a comeback. </s> <s> She@-@s the comeback kid, just like her husband was. </s> <s> @-@Kornblut said that, belatedly, a few members of Clinton@-@s inner circle came to believe that her frequently gender-neutral approach wasn@-@t just @-@a big mistake of the campaign. </s> <s> That was the big strategic mistake. </s> <s> @-@But with an even longer r@-@sum@-@ now, Clinton could emphasize her trailblazing womanhood for 2016 without the worry that many voters would misinterpret it as the main qualification that she@-@s claiming. </s> <s> And after four years as a secretary of state more hawkish than the president she served, she wouldn@-@t have to push the image of a dauntless world leader. </s> <s> Americans@-@ economic anxieties will almost surely be at the center of the race, and with the right language, Clinton might have @-@the ability to talk as mom and grandmom about the need to make sure government is on the side of our families,@-@ Chris Lehane, a Democratic strategist who recently addressed the group Ready for Hillary, told me. </s> <s> @-@Being a woman translates into great politics,@-@ he said. </s> <s> Clinton seemingly agrees. </s> <s> Over the last year she has weighed in strongly on issues like equal pay and child care. </s> <s> She has done women-themed events galore. </s> <s> In a speech at Georgetown University last week, she said: @-@We know when women contribute in making and keeping peace, entire societies enjoy better outcomes. </s> <s> Women leaders, it has been found, are good at building coalitions across ethnic and sectarian lines and speaking up for other marginalized groups. </s> <s> @-@IT@-@S possible that Clinton has noticed polls. </s> <s> In one by Gallup early this year, when Americans were asked what about a Clinton presidency would be most exciting, the answer given more than any other was that she would be the first woman in the job. </s> <s> It@-@s her @-@unique selling proposition,@-@ wrote Frank Newport, Gallup@-@s editor in chief, in an analysis of those results. </s> <s> And that proposition is potentially an inoculation. </s> <s> Yes, she@-@s been around forever and isn@-@t a fresh face. </s> <s> But she can@-@t be yesterday@-@s news when she@-@s tomorrow@-@s precedent. </s> <s> Yes, there@-@s a whiff of dynasty about her. </s> <s> But maybe she gets some of the @-@new car smell@-@ that Obama said voters were looking for by promising a new altitude of female accomplishment. </s> <s> Yes, a contest between her and Jeb Bush would be one of two surnames from the past. </s> <s> But only she can claim to represent an uncharted future, at least in one sense. </s> <s> Yes, detractors will say that she@-@s a third term of Obama: business as usual. </s> <s> Her supporters can answer that she@-@s history@-@s unfinished business. </s> <s> Yes, she@-@s now wealthy and well-connected, and would be

</s> <s> Does he believe that the goal of winning office is winning office? </s> <s> @-@In a more detailed critique, Michael Hiltzik, a Los Angeles Times columnist, wrote:Schumer gets the positive impact of the legislation wrong, he gets the politics of it wrong, and he displays a shocking ignorance of the problems facing the American middle class. </s> <s> Hiltzik argued that the legislation fixed the problems of a @-@system of tying insurance to employment and pricing non-employer insurance out of reach, often because of pre-existing medical conditions. </s> <s> @-@ In addition, according to Hiltzik, the legislation willoutlaw limitations that were creeping into employer plans,@-@ which will in turn create more opportunity for middle-class workers by removing barriers for those @-@stuck in unrewarding jobs simply for the health coverage. </s> <s> Wendell Primus, a top policy adviser to Pelosi, disputed Schumer@-@s characterization of Obama@-@s health care initiative. </s> <s> In an email to me, Primus contended that some of the economic benefits of Obamacare do flow to the largely white middle class, that 8.3 million seniors on Medicare have benefited from expanded prescription drug coverage by an average of @-@1,443 per person, for total savings of @-@12 billion, and that Obamacare has contributed to a sharp reduction in the growth of Medicare Part B premiums. </s> <s> From 2000 to 2008, Primus noted, these fees rose 112 percent, from @-@45.50 per month to @-@96.40 per month, while through the subsequent eight-year period, premiums are expected to rise by only 10 percent, from @-@96.40 to @-@106.50 a month. </s> <s> The views of Democratic advocates of Obamacare notwithstanding, public opinion has generally sided with Schumer. </s> <s> A United Technologies@-@National Journal Congressional connection poll of 1,013 adults in mid-November 2013 found that by a 25-point margin, 59-34, respondents said that the health care law @-@which includes a major expansion of Medicaid to cover anyone up to 133 percent of the poverty line, and subsidies for the purchase of private insurance for those between 133 percent and 400 percent of the poverty line@-@ would make things better for the poor. </s> <s> But respondents also said, by a 16-point margin, 49-33, that the law would make things worse for @-@people like you and your family. </s> <s> @-@ White respondents were even more critical, with 58 percent saying that Obamacare would make things worse for people like you and your family, and 63 percent saying it would make things worse @-@for the middle class. </s> <s> @-@Exit poll data from 1994, after President Clinton@-@s failed bid to pass health care reform, as well as from 2010 and 2014, provides further support for the Schumer argument. </s> <s> In each of those three midterm elections there were huge white defections from the Democratic Party; in 2010 and 2014, there were comparable defections of senior voters. </s> <s> The loss of white supporters of House Democratic candidates can be seen in the data. </s> <s> In 1992, white voters split 50-50 between Democratic and Republican House candidates; in 1994, after the Hillarycare debacle, they voted Republican 58-42. </s> <s> By 2010 and 2014, whites voted for Republican House candidates by a 24-point margin, 62-38. </s> <s> The defection of seniors is most striking when comparing exit poll data from 2006 and 2010. </s> <s> In 2006, seniors of all races voted 52-48 for Democratic House candidates; in 2010, they voted 58-42 for Republican House candidates. </s> <s> The only way for Democratic Party leaders to stop the hemorrhaging, in Schumer@-@s view, is to take on the task of using the government to intervene in the private sector, pushing to raise wages and revive job opportunities for working men and women. </s> <s> @-@Large forces @-@ technology, automation and globalization @-@ are not inherently malign forces,@-@ Schumer said, but the burden is on Democrats @-@to figure out ways for the middle class to adapt to these new forces @-@ to be able to thrive amidst these forces. </s> <s> @-@ The only counterweight @-@that can give you the tools to stand up to the large tectonic forces, that can mitigate the effects that technology creates on your income, is an active and committed government that is on your side. </s> <s> @-@Standing in the way of activist intervention is the fact that @-@the American public is so cynical about government that a Democratic, pro-government message would not be immediately successful. </s> <s> @-@ To restore credibility, Schumer argued, the @-@first step is to convince voters that we are on their side, and not in the grips of special interests. </s> <s> @-@ He specifically suggested the prosecution of bankers for @-@what seems, on its face, blatant fraud@-@ and tax reform designed to ensure that C. E. O.s paid higher rates @-@than their secretaries. </s> <s> @-@ In effect, he said, @-@an element of populism, even for those of us who don@-@t consider ourselves populists, is necessary to open the door before we can rally people to the view that a strong government program must be implemented. </s> <s> @-@The ability of the Democratic Party to convince middle-class voters that it is on their side is by no means guaranteed. </s> <s> In mid-November, 2008, just after Obama first won election, 55 percent of voters had a favorable view of the Democratic Party. </s> <s> In the immediate aftermath of the recent election, according to Gallup, the favorability rating of the Democratic Party had fallen to a record low of 36 percent. </s> <s> During a September pre-election panel discussion on the continuing political repercussions of the Affordable Care Act, Charlie Cook, editor of the Cook Report, put his finger on the health care problem facing Democrats when he pointed out that the public perception of the party has been indelibly imprinted by Obamacare. </s> <s> The Affordable Care Act has @-@framed where the Democratic Party is,@-@ Cook said. </s> <s> @-@If I would sum up my assessment, it was huge, it did play a central role in framing everything. </s> <s> @-@ By 2014, health care reform @-@lost a little bit of its oomph, but it still is more important in setting things up than any other issue was over the last six years. </s> <s> @-@By shifting the public focus to the party@-@s pro-work and pro-wage policies, Schumer wants to transform the negative association of the Democratic Party with Obamacare. </s> <s> Even as his speech has provoked an intraparty rift, Schumer@-@s argument has won support from some surprising quarters. </s> <s> A spokesman for Senator Elizabeth Warren told reporters that Warren @-@agrees with Senator Schumer that there was an urgent need in 2009 and 2010 to help middle-class families who were struggling to get by, and that more should have been done. </s> <s> @-@ Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island told Politico: @-@I agree with Chuck that the A. C. A. was essential, as our health care system was unjust and spinning out of control. </s> <s> I also agree that if we could have done more infrastructure first it would have connected more with working Americans, and our sales job was less than stellar. </s> <s> @-@A Brookings Institution analysis of the winners and losers from Obamacare found that the program redistributes costs to the top 80 percent of the income distribution in order to provide benefits to the bottom 20 percent. </s> <s> The analysis, shown in Figure 1, reports thatincomes in the bottom one-fifth of the distribution will increase almost 6 percent; those in the bottom one-tenth of the distribution will rise more than 7 percent. </s> <s> These estimated gains represent averages. </s> <s> Most people already have insurance coverage that will be left largely unaffected by reform. </s> <s> Those who gain subsidized insurance will see bigger percentage gains in their income. </s> <s> Of the 60 Democratic senators who voted for Obamacare in 2010, 28 are no longer in office. </s> <s> Of course, not all of the retirements and defeats can be attributed to the advent of Obamacare, but the numbers are striking. </s> <s> The electoral scorecard suggests that Schumer may have less opposition than anticipated to his bid to shift the central concern of the party to more overtly economic issues. </s> <s> Insofar as Democrats try to reduce hostility to Obamacare, they face two problems. </s> <s> The first is a Republican Party unwilling to support any legislation making the A. C. A. more palatable. </s> <s> The other is the danger that tinkering with any of the provisions that have provoked the strongest opposition could eviscerate the legislation. </s> <s> Among the provisions that have stirred opposition are the requirement that most Americans get coverage, the tax on medical devices and the excise tax on expensive, high-quality private health coverage. </s> <s> Removing existing provisions would require replacing lost funding with new revenue sources, which could provoke anger from multiple constituencies. </s> <s> As if Democrats do not already have enough trouble, data released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shows that many, if not most, of the seven million people who purchased insurance through the A. C. A. will either have to pay higher premiums or higher deductibles, or submit themselves to the complex process of switching plans. </s> <s> Democrats have a lot going for them in presidential years. </s> <s> Nonetheless, at the moment you@-@d have to say that they have their work cut out for them. </s> <s> Even though midterm elections favor Republicans, the 2014 results show middle- and working-class dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party rising to dangerous levels, which threatens the party@-@s growing demographic advantages. </s> <s> Perhaps most notably, Republican House candidates in 2014 won 37 percent of the Hispanic vote, their highest percentage since Republicans rejected immigration reform in 2005, and a slight majority, 51-49, of Asian-American voters, who had been moving decisively in the Democrats@-@ favor. </s> <s> Asian-Americans and Hispanics are crucial to future Democratic presidential victories. </s> <s> In combination with the growing Republican allegiance of whites, these trends raise the possibility that the Democratic plan for victory by demographics could implode, which would make the case for a full scale re-evaluation of its strategies and policies glaringly obvious. </s> <s> Whatever you think of Senator Schumer, you begin to understand why he spoke out as forcefully as he did. </s> <s> Mark BittmanBy Mark BittmanI don@-@t know how Chris Christie plans to become president, but then again no one could have predicted George W. Bush, or for that matter Barack Obama, so we know that stranger things have happened. </s> <s> In any case, I@-@d love to see the guy@-@s political prospects fall apart over pork, and not the kind you@-@re thinking of. </s> <s> Rather, I@-@m hoping he@-@ll become a primary example of how reactionary food policy will no longer play. </s> <s> Last week, Christie vetoed a bill that would have banned the use of gestation crates in New Jersey. </s> <s> Gestation crates, as you might know, are essentially solitary confinement jail cells for pregnant pigs. </s> <s> The mothers spend time during their @-@productive@-@ years in these, unable to turn around and barely able to move back and forth. </s> <s> I would call that torture, and it would seem that forbidding that practice in your state would be the right thing to do. </s> <s> Passage of the bill would actually have little impact. </s> <s> There are only 9,000 pigs in the whole of New Jersey. </s> <s> There are, however, 65 million pigs in the United States, over 20 million of them in Iowa @-@where crates are standard practice@-@, which is clearly what Christie has in mind: a candidate who supports the status quo on agriculture in Iowa, where the hog industry is worth @-@7 billion, has it far easier than one who wants to shake things up. </s> <s> Why a state that has almost seven times as many pigs as people should play a bigger role in determining who gets to be president than one @-@New Jersey@-@ that has, say, 1,000 times as many people as pigs is another story, more about our dysfunctional political system than raising animals. </s> <s> For Christie, however, that@-@s exactly what this is about @-@ not animal cruelty, but politics. </s> <s> He can@-@t afford to alienate Iowa, which has a quarter of all U. S. hog slaughter capacity, as well as all-important momentum early in the presidential nomination contest. </s> <s> And he@-@ll do almost anything to get the support of that state@-@s governor, Terry Branstad, who himself doesn@-@t quite seem to know what a gestation crate actually is. </s> <s> What Christie fails to recognize is that gestation crates are over, and even Iowa farmers know that, because most of the biggest pork producers and commercial consumers have pledged to stop using them within a few years. </s> <s> Among those: the fast food @-@leaders@-@ McDonald@-@s, Burger King and Wendy@-@s; the pork suppliers Smithfield, ConAgra Foods, Hormel and Cargill; the food service giants Aramark, Compass Group, Sysco and Sodexo; the retail operations Costco, Kroger and Safeway; and dozens of others, most of which are household names. </s> <s> Oh, and guess what? </s> <s> Nine states have already outlawed the use of gestation crates. </s> <s> @-@Five ban or restrict the use of battery cages for chickens, the next ultra-cruel practice of industrial agriculture to be terminated. </s> <s> Give it five or 10 years. </s> <s> @-@ Nearly everyone in New Jersey supported this bill, both in office, where it passed both houses easily, and by poll, with 9 out of 10 Jerseyites wanting Christie to sign it. </s> <s> That didn@-@t matter to the governor, who called the bill @-@a solution in search of a problem. </s> <s> @-@ I think it@-@s more a question of a presidential candidate in search of a vote, no matter what ethics or principles he needs to step on. </s> <s> I don@-@t consider myself an animal lover, but I like to think I@-@m an animal respecter. </s> <s> I have some ethical reservations about eating animals but they don@-@t reach a point where I won@-@t do it. </s> <s> I have ethical reservations about driving and flying, also, which so far haven@-@t stopped me. </s> <s> Call me a hypocrite, but life is complicated and hypocrisy is not the same as opportunism. </s> <s> Still, there@-@s no reason to torture animals @-@ living, feeling creatures @-@ and I can@-@t condone it, even if it@-@s happening in another state, and even if the industry both a@-@ likes to pretend the torture is beneficial and b@-@ tries to hide it from anyone who@-@s determined to look. </s> <s> @-@To be clear: Pigs have indeed been bred to be raised in confinement, and returning them to a more natural state is a lengthy process. </s> <s> The long view suggests banning gestation crates but also raising pigs and other animals in humane rather than cruel conditions. </s> <s> @-@Christie@-@s veto may be overruled and, practically @-@ when it comes to confinement @-@ it may not make much of a difference. </s> <s> Unless his Machiavellian political ploys come home to roost in 2016. </s> <s> Compare Christie@-@s judgment with that of Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who wants to ban horse-and-carriage rides in Central Park. </s> <s> Even though it isn@-@t a direct parallel, this is a move that will affect almost no one @-@ there are around 200 horses working as carriage-pullers, and 160 drivers @-@ and it@-@s not a signal move against animal cruelty. </s> <s> Personally I would just as soon see the horse-and-carriage rigs taken off the streets and out of the park, along with pedicabs, but tourists seem to like them, and arguing against the tourist trade is also another story. </s> <s> Some of these horses are rescue animals, and although putting a horse to work pounding the pavements isn@-@t exactly @-@natural,@-@ once you@-@re exploiting other species to benefit humans it@-@s difficult to know where to draw the line. </s> <s> Even so, I don@-@t think this qualifies as @-@torture@-@ to the degree that gestation crates clearly do. </s> <s> Christie is cravenly flouting the reality that animal welfare matters to the public, and that welfare activists have developed a bit of clout. </s> <s> De Blasio made a campaign promise, maybe not an

</s> <s> @-@ who speaks to the issues of upward mobility and incomes. </s> <s> @-@ Both Senator Brown and Senator Tester have staked out populist positions in support of their working-class constituents in Ohio and Montana. </s> <s> Most Democratic politicians and strategists, according to Kotkin, @-@just have no feel at all @-@ as Harry Truman and Bill Clinton did, for example @-@ for the aspirations of the middle class. </s> <s> This is why they are losing them, and deservedly so. </s> <s> @-@Morris Fiorina, a political scientist at Stanford, is similarly critical of the @-@upscale capture@-@ of the Democratic Party. </s> <s> In an email, he wrote that in the aftermath of the financial collapse of 2008,the country is desperate for economic relief, but as time goes on it becomes clear that the administration@-@s economic policy is to take care of the financial sector, where hundreds of people are clearly guilty of fraud in any layman@-@s view. </s> <s> The result is building disappointment, resentment, and rage in the public, which results in the 2010 debacle. </s> <s> @-@Today,@-@ Fiorina writes,We have a situation where voters can choose between a party that openly admits to being a lap dog of Wall Street and a party that by its actions clearly is a lap dog but denies it. </s> <s> At least vote for the honest one. </s> <s> Asked about Webb, Fiorina replied, @-@the emotional side of me loves him. </s> <s> @-@ But, Fiorina cautioned, @-@the rational side is worried about how he would actually behave if he were president. </s> <s> @-@Further to the left side of the political spectrum, Krystal Marie Ball, co-host of the MSNBC show The Cycle, waxed poetic on the air about the former Virginia senator on Nov. 22, telling viewers that Webb was @-@such a contrast from Hillary Clinton. </s> <s> @-@Clinton, Ball said,is polished and produced and perfectly calibrated. </s> <s> He is not. </s> <s> He is rough. </s> <s> He is authentic. </s> <s> He cares about issues. </s> <s> He speaks plainly. </s> <s> He doesn@-@t try to oversmile, for example, he just is exactly who he is. </s> <s> And there@-@s something very compelling about that, and it is a stark contrast from the very carefully packaged and branded Clinton image. </s> <s> Al Hunt, a Bloomberg columnist, warned that Webb @-@could be Hillary Clinton@-@s worst nightmare,@-@ noting that Webbseems an improbable candidate. </s> <s> He has taken illiberal positions, was President Ronald Reagan@-@s Navy secretary, has few relationships within the Democratic Party, and has no serious fund-raising network. </s> <s> What he does possess is a long-held and forceful opposition to U. S. interventions in Iraq and Libya, and potentially Syria, as well as solid anti-Wall Street credentials. </s> <s> In Democratic primaries, these may be Clinton@-@s greatest impediments to rallying a hard-core activist base. </s> <s> To gauge Webb@-@s prospects, I looked at the exit poll data for the 2006 Virginia Senate race, when he unseated George Allen, the favored Republican. </s> <s> I then compared Webb@-@s performance among key constituencies to the performance of all House Democrats running nationwide in the same year. </s> <s> The results of this comparison do not support the portrayal of Webb as a candidate equipped to win over key white constituencies. </s> <s> Take, for example, the ballots cast by white men. </s> <s> Webb lost among these voters by a 24-point margin, 38-62. </s> <s> Exit poll data on all House races in 2006 shows that Democratic House candidates lost white men by a smaller 9-point margin, 44-53. </s> <s> White women voted for Allen over Webb by 53-47; while House Democratic candidates split the votes of white women, 49-50. </s> <s> Similarly, self-identified conservatives chose Allen over Webb by a 76-point margin, 12-88, while House Democratic candidates lost this segment of the electorate by a substantial but smaller margin, 58 points @-@20-78@-@. </s> <s> Webb did not do any better with white evangelical and born-again Protestants, losing these voters by a larger margin than did House Democratic candidates. </s> <s> To further check the validity of these comparisons, I looked at 2006 exit polls in two other close Democratic Senate contests, in Montana, where Tester beat Conrad Burns by less than 3,000 votes, 198,302 to 195,455, and Claire McCaskill in Missouri, who beat the incumbent Republican Jim Talent, 50-47. </s> <s> Tester and McCaskill both performed better among white men and women, conservatives and white born-again and evangelical Protestants, than Webb did. </s> <s> Let@-@s forget Webb for a moment and take the question a step further. </s> <s> What are the prospects of winning the presidential nomination for a candidate who challenges current Democratic Party strategic orthodoxy? </s> <s> This strategy calls for identity group, rather than class-based, mobilization, on the assumption that turning out single women, the young, and racial and ethnic minorities is more effective than an uphill struggle to revive support in the recalcitrant white middle and working class. </s> <s> As much as such a shift to a class-based strategy might result in economic policies more beneficial to less affluent Democratic constituencies, and therefore to more votes in the long haul, so far there has been insufficient intraparty pressure to force a change in strategic orientation. </s> <s> It is not lost on Democratic strategists that President Obama won twice deploying a group-based rather than a class-based strategy. </s> <s> Even if the next Democratic nominee does not inspire the high minority turnout levels of 2008 and 2012, the 2016 electorate will be less Republican than it was in 2012. </s> <s> Every four years, the heavily Republican white share of voters drops by a little over 2 percent, and the disproportionately Democratic minority share grows by the same amount. </s> <s> There are, however, fundamental problems with the current Democratic strategy, not least of which is that it is a strategy for winning presidential elections but not necessarily for exerting real political control. </s> <s> The current approach depends on a Republican Party that refuses to adjust to the transforming composition of the electorate. </s> <s> The 2014 elections demonstrated, however, that the Republican Party and its candidates are not immune to feedback and will change if they have to in order to win. </s> <s> Insofar as the Republican Party tempers its retrograde stance on social-sexual and moral-racial issues, Democratic campaigns stressing alleged threats from conservatives @-@ the threat to freedom and privacy posed by the Christian right; the threat to Hispanic family unity posed by anti-immigrant activists; the threat to programs serving the poor posed by deficit hawks @-@ will run out of gas. </s> <s> That moment may be closer than expected. </s> <s> An Oct. 15 Washington Post@-@ABC poll found that the public held the Democratic Party @-@in worse regard than at any point in the past 30 years. </s> <s> @-@ An Oct. 24 Pew Research Center survey found, in turn, that the public favored Republicans over Democrats on such key issues as handling the economy, the budget deficit, immigration and terrorism. </s> <s> Democrats, according to Pew, retained an advantage on less tangible qualities such as empathy, honesty and a willingness to compromise. </s> <s> As attractive as those characteristics are, they are not top priorities for voters. </s> <s> Both Pew and Gallup have found that, except in times of crisis @-@ for example, in the aftermath of the 9@-@11 attacks @-@ voters@-@ top priorities consistently include bread-and-butter issues, jobs and the economy. </s> <s> In September 2006, just before Democrats regained control of the House and Senate, the party held a 30-point advantage, 58-28, on the question, @-@which party is better able to handle the economy,@-@ according to Gallup. </s> <s> Going into the 2014 elections, Gallup found there had been a huge swing on this question, with Republicans now ahead 48-43. </s> <s> If those numbers do not change significantly before Nov. 8, 2016, it won@-@t matter whether the nominee seeks to strengthen a biracial coalition by broadening white support or by increasing turnout among the party@-@s identity group constituencies. </s> <s> The Democrats@-@ lack of credibility on economic issues will hobble, if not extinguish, the party@-@s prospects. </s> <s> Unless the Democrats develop a coherent, comprehensive strategy for the have-nots, it won@-@t matter whether the party@-@s nominee is Clinton, Webb or anyone else. </s> <s> Good Tuesday morning from Washington, where the repercussions of Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel@-@s resignation and a grand jury decision over the death of Michael Brown are playing out. </s> <s> Senate Republicans are getting ready to test their influence in confirmation hearings, and we look at the three finalists to host the Democratic convention in 2016. </s> <s> The split-screen coverage on CNN summed up the story. </s> <s> On the left, President Obama was making a personal appeal for calm;

Black Jr., a longtime Republican strategist, referring to the changes made by the Republican National Committee to compress the primary schedule and nominating convention. </s> <s> While the would-be candidates are taking public steps to assert themselves, the action has been just as intense behind the scenes as they build political operations. </s> <s> Jeb Bush has started reaching out to Republicans in early primary states, including Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, whom he called on election night. </s> <s> And he met with Spencer Zwick, Mr. Romney@-@s finance director, this year. </s> <s> Yet Mr. Bush has not decided on a bid, and those familiar with his thinking say he will give no indication until next year. </s> <s> Some of his private comments in recent months @-@ musing about the need for a @-@pain threshold@-@ to run and complaining about a video tracker that the liberal group American Bridge assigned to him @-@ raise doubts about his intentions. </s> <s> Still, some of Mr. Bush@-@s confidants have had informal conversations with potential aides. </s> <s> Sally Bradshaw and Mike Murphy, his two closest advisers, have quietly met with campaign lawyers, data specialists and donors. </s> <s> While Mr. Bush was in Washington to attend his education foundation@-@s conference, Ms. Bradshaw spent days in the capital visiting with a number of Republicans. </s> <s> They included two of the party@-@s most in-demand strategists after its success this month: Rob Collins, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and Liesl Hickey, executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee. </s> <s> Ready or not, the midterm elections signal the unofficial start of the next presidential campaign. </s> <s> Assessing the prospects of some likely candidates. </s> <s> Mr. Christie@-@s supporters have been just as aggressive. </s> <s> They envision him establishing a political organization in the coming months to raise money. </s> <s> They also foresee a top role for Phil Cox, who is stepping down as executive director of the Republican Governors Association. </s> <s> @-@The governor has really come to appreciate Phil@-@s talents and counsel,@-@ said William J.

Bush won about 40 percent in his 2004 victory. </s> <s> But in 2016 Hispanics will represent just 12 percent of eligible voters, and between 9 and 10 percent of actual voters. </s> <s> That@-@s a lot, but it@-@s not large enough to grant or deny Republicans the presidency. </s> <s> The math is simple: A 10-point gain among 10 percent of the electorate yields an additional point in the popular vote. </s> <s> Mr. Obama won by a 3.9-point margin in 2012. </s> <s> So even if the next Republican presidential candidate received the magical 40 percent of Hispanic voters that Mr. Bush received in 2004 @-@ which seems unlikely in a fairly competitive national election @-@ it still wouldn@-@t erase Mr. Romney@-@s deficit in the popular vote. </s> <s> Hispanic voters are disproportionately concentrated in noncompetitive states like Texas and California. </s> <s> This makes it even harder for the Republicans to claim the presidency by focusing on them, since there are relatively few Hispanic voters in the battleground states that determine who wins the Electoral College. </s> <s> Hispanics represent more than 5 percent of eligible voters in just three battlegrounds: Florida, Nevada and Colorado. </s> <s> As a result, the Republicans could have entirely erased Mr. Obama@-@s advantage among Hispanic voters and still lost the presidency in 2012, since Mr. Romney would have still lost states like Virginia and Ohio, where there are very few Hispanic voters. </s> <s> Why, then, do so many assume that the Republican path to the presidency is through Hispanic voters? </s> <s> It was the result of an incorrect inference from Mr. Obama@-@s performance among white voters in national exit polls, which showed Mr. Obama losing the white vote by 20 points, worse than any Democrat since Walter Mondale in 1984. </s> <s> The implication was that Republicans had done all they could among white voters. </s> <s> The Republicans therefore had to make gains among Hispanic voters instead @-@another assumption being that Republicans couldn@-@t make big improvements among black voters@-@. </s> <s> But the national exit poll finding for white voters was misleading. </s> <s> Nearly all of Mr. Obama@-@s weakness was attributable to the South and Appalachia, where Mr. Obama suffered catastrophic losses compared with prior Democrats. </s> <s> Mr. Obama in fact performed quite well among white voters outside of the South, easily winning overwhelmingly white states like Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, Wisconsin and New Hampshire, which were all extremely competitive in one or both of the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. </s> <s> The state exit polls most likely overstated Mr. Obama@-@s weakness among white voters as well, often supposing unrealistic levels of nonwhite turnout. </s> <s> The next Republican presidential candidate could fare better than Mr. Romney among white voters by retaining Mr. Romney@-@s strength among Southern white voters and merely returning to Mr. Bush@-@s showing in many areas north of the Mason-Dixon line. </s> <s> The strong G. O. P. showing in the midterm elections was highly consistent with this pattern, with Southern Democrats barely outperforming Mr. Obama, and Republican candidates like Joni Ernst and Cory Gardner making big improvements over Mr. Romney@-@s performance among white voters, and particularly among white, rural voters without a college degree. </s> <s> Improving among white Northern voters is the core of the G. O. P. route to victory, regardless of whether the party makes gains with Hispanic voters. </s> <s> If the Republicans can@-@t make gains among white Northerners and hold Mr. Romney@-@s share of white Southerners, it just won@-@t really matter whether they receive 25 or 40 percent of the Hispanic vote. </s> <s> But if the Republicans don@-@t make any gains among Hispanic voters, they will be taking a big risk. </s> <s> Hispanic voters are still important @-@ and it@-@s easy to imagine a situation in which Republican gains among Hispanics are in fact necessary to win. </s> <s> That situation turns on Florida. </s> <s> The Republicans don@-@t have an especially credible path to the presidency without Florida@-@s 29 electoral votes. </s> <s> The easiest alternative might be for Republicans to flip Virginia and Ohio, scale the so-called Blue Wall in Pennsylvania, and then pick up 12 additional electoral votes from some combination of Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin and New Hampshire. </s> <s> The G. O. P. path to the presidency all but closes if the Democrats combine Florida and Pennsylvania. </s> <s> Florida was the closest state of the 2012 presidential election, and Hispanics will most likely represent 19 percent of eligible voters in 2016, up from 17 percent in 2012. </s> <s> Florida@-@s Hispanic voters are somewhat more conservative than those elsewhere, in part because of the state@-@s distinctive enclave of Cuban-Americans. </s> <s> But Democrats gained ground among Cuban-Americans in the Obama elections and the governor@-@s race this year. </s> <s> And Florida@-@s Hispanic population has moved toward the left over the last decade, as non-Cuban Hispanics have come into the state. </s> <s> For example, heavily Democratic Puerto Rican voters have transformed the once competitive Orlando-Kissimmee area. </s> <s> Florida was so close in 2012 that even fairly modest Republican improvements would be enough to overcome Mr. Obama@-@s one-point margin of victory and the effects of four more years of demographic change, which will draw the white share of eligible voters down to 62 percent, from 65 percent in 2012. </s> <s> But there are more reasons to question whether the G. O. P. has as much room to improve among white voters as it does elsewhere. </s> <s> Unlike in most of the battlegrounds, Mr. Obama really did fare unusually poorly among the state@-@s white voters. </s> <s> According to the exit polls, Mr. Obama lost white voters in Florida by 24 points. </s> <s> If he had merely lost them by the same 15-point margin as John Kerry, he would have won decisively @-@ a fact that highlights the tremendous importance of Democratic improvements among Hispanic voters and the pace of demographic change in a state that Mr. Kerry lost by five points in 2004. </s> <s> The state@-@s white population was an unusual mix of nearly all of Mr. Obama@-@s weaknesses: older, Southern, Jewish. </s> <s> That same mix also means the state@-@s white voters might be more amenable to another Democratic candidate, like Hillary Clinton, who also represented a good number of the state@-@s New York expats when she was a senator last decade. </s> <s> None of this is to say that the Republicans can@-@t do much better among Florida@-@s white voters than Mr. Romney. </s> <s> The point is that it@-@s easy to imagine a situation where it turns out that the G. O. P.@-@s opportunities for additional improvement are not enough to roll back Mr. Obama@-@s margin of victory and four more years of demographic change. </s> <s> In that event, Republicans would be very well served by gains, even modest ones, among the state@-@s Hispanics. </s> <s> The question of what Republicans must do to appeal to Hispanic voters is an entirely separate one. </s> <s> It is possible that the same dissatisfaction with the Obama administration that might help Republicans among Northern white voters might also allow them to make gains among Hispanic voters, even if Republicans don@-@t make any substantive changes on immigration. </s> <s> On the other hand, immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship might be emerging as a litmus test for whether candidates are seen as hostile to the country@-@s growing Latino population. </s> <s> This much is clear: Additional Hispanic voters could be a big help to Republicans, and the party@-@s position on immigration will make the effort to appeal to Hispanics far more challenging. </s> <s> If the Republicans don@-@t make gains among Hispanics, they@-@ll need to make up for it elsewhere. </s> <s> It@-@s not impossible, but it is harder @-@ especially in Florida. </s> <s> Jim Webb, a Democratic former senator from Virginia, has announced that he is launching an exploratory committee for a potential 2016 presidential run. </s> <s> @-@I@-@ve proudly spent several periods in government, but I am not a career politician,@-@ Mr. Webb said in a 14-minute video posted by the Webb 2016 YouTube account. </s> <s> He added, @-@I look@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@ forward to listening and talking with more people in the coming months as I decide whether or not to run.@-@Mr. </s> <s> Webb has also launched a website for his exploratory committee. </s> <s> Long rumored to be contemplating a run, Mr. Webb is considered a long shot to win the Democratic nomination. </s> <s> @-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@ First Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times. </s> <s> Come back throughout the day for the latest news and analysis, and be part of the political conversation. </s> <s> @-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@ @-@Like it?

would be like having @-@6,000 in cash to spend on health insurance. </s> <s> If the family found a plan they liked for less, they could put the difference in a health savings account to help cover out-of-pocket expenses. </s> <s> These tax credits would benefit everyone, whereas under the Affordable Care Act premium assistance almost exclusively benefits the near-poor and the near-elderly, at great cost to the middle class and the young. </s> <s> A household in Virginia of two 36-year-olds making @-@63,000 a year gets no subsidy under Obamacare, but under my plan, they@-@d get a tax credit worth @-@4,200. </s> <s> And those with policies covering adult children up to their 26th birthday could keep them. </s> <s> This plan also has protections for people with pre-existing conditions. </s> <s> Parents with newborns would have six months to buy insurance for the baby without having to pay more for pre-existing conditions, as would young adults who went off their parents@-@ plans. </s> <s> Anyone who was insured for a year through an employer but lost that insurance would have two months to buy an individual-market plan, using the tax credit, without having to pay more for a pre-existing condition. </s> <s> No one with continuous coverage could be dropped from his or her insurance, or be re-priced, because of a pre-existing condition. </s> <s> My plan would also allocate @-@7.5 billion a year for state-run @-@high risk@-@ pools. </s> <s> People who couldn@-@t afford insurance on the open market because of a pre-existing condition could not be turned away from these pools or forced to pay more toward their premiums than they could afford. </s> <s> These reforms provide consumer protections but prevent people from gaming the system by going without insurance until they get a costly diagnosis. </s> <s> Repealing Obamacare@-@s mandates and letting people shop for value as they do when they buy auto insurance would lower health care costs. </s> <s> So, too, would encouraging states to enact sensible medical-malpractice reforms and capping the tax break on employer-based insurance at @-@20,000 per family plan. </s> <s> Under my alternative, Medicaid would revert to pre-Obamacare eligibility levels. </s> <s> Anyone who was added to Medicaid under Obamacare would be free to buy personal insurance with their new tax credits. </s> <s> Those who remained on Medicaid could voluntarily switch to them. </s> <s> Such reforms would lower premiums, increase consumer choice and not disrupt doctor-patient relationships. </s> <s> According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Center for Health and Economy, the very similar 2017 Project plan was estimated to save @-@1.1 trillion in federal spending over 10 years versus Obamacare, while reducing insurance premiums and enhancing access to doctors. </s> <s> Rolling back the irresponsible expansion of Medicaid would raise the number of uninsured, but this plan would increase the number of people with private insurance by six million, a better model for sustainable growth. </s> <s> Obviously, enacting legislation along these lines will require a Republican president. </s> <s> That will be more likely if over the next two years the Republican majorities in Congress pave the intellectual way through hearings and committee reports for a positive Obamacare alternative that the Republican presidential nominee can take to the electorate. </s> <s> By Mark Leibovich@-@If I fix this, you have to start the story with it,@-@ Chris Christie told me, yanking the string of the venetian blind in the diner window. </s> <s> We were eating a late lunch at a place called Howley@-@s, next to a motor lodge on South Dixie Highway, in West Palm Beach. </s> <s> It was the last Sunday in October, nine days before the midterm elections, and the 4 p.m. twilight was beaming directly into the eyes of the governor of New Jersey. </s> <s> Christie@-@s communications director, Maria Comella, had already tried and failed to lower the blinds, inadvertently bunching them up even more. </s> <s> I had given it a shot, too. </s> <s> Finally, Christie rose and maneuvered himself across the booth to make his own attempt. </s> <s> Walking with a slight limp, which he occasionally does after sitting for a while, Christie grabbed the strings, one in each hand, tugged a few times and grunted. </s> <s> Then, after a final jerk, the blinds fell splendidly into place. </s> <s> @-@There@-@s the lead of your story,@-@ Christie said, letting out a high-pitched laugh and lifting his arms in triumph. </s> <s> The people sitting at a nearby table did double takes, but it was hard to tell if they recognized Christie or simply wondered why the big guy in the corner booth was raising his arms and giggling. </s> <s> @-@When Christie becomes excited, his voice achieves the tenor of Fred Flintstone shouting over Wilma@-@s vacuum. </s> <s> @-@ Christie once again looked admiringly at the blinds. </s> <s> @-@There@-@s the lead,@-@ he said. </s> <s> The governor then sat back down to his nachos, which were dripping grease and piled prodigiously with three scoops of sour cream and guacamole over melted cheese. </s> <s> Diced tomatoes spilled onto the table. </s> <s> Christie, who has lost about 100 pounds since undergoing lap-band surgery last year, stopped drinking soda and rarely drinks alcohol, except for an occasional vodka @-@to take the edge off. </s> <s> @-@ But he hasn@-@t relinquished some old delights. </s> <s> He surveyed the nachos and grabbed a large deck hewed together by coagulated Cheddar. </s> <s> @-@We don@-@t mess around,@-@ he said, bringing the cluster to his lips. </s> <s> @-@I didn@-@t have breakfast today,@-@ he added, as if by way of explanation. </s> <s> And then: @-@I had a little bit of ice cream around lunchtime. </s> <s> @-@ When I asked if he felt better after his weight loss, Christie replied that he felt much the same physically but @-@much better psychologically. </s> <s> @-@ He said he takes vitamins to stay healthy. </s> <s> Christie was approaching the end of a breakneck weekend. </s> <s> On Friday night, a nurse who had treated Ebola patients in West Africa landed at Newark International Airport and was checked into a hospital after screeners said she had a fever, setting off a scare across the state. </s> <s> Christie, who mandated that she be quarantined, stayed up until 1 a.m. to learn of her diagnosis @-@ she tested negative @-@ before eventually dozing off at 3 a.m. </s> <s> He awoke two hours later to fly west to Lincoln, Neb., where he spent the morning at a football tailgate with the Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete Ricketts. </s> <s> He then made his third trip in a year to Iowa for a fund-raising event with Representative Steve King, at a pheasant lodge in Akron, before working his way east to Clive, a suburb of Des Moines, to attend the annual birthday dinner for Terry Branstad, the state@-@s longtime governor. </s> <s> Branstad was up double-digits in polls and in no danger of losing, but Christie insisted on being there anyway. </s> <s> @-@People ask me why I keep coming to Iowa,@-@ Christie said in his speech, the standard rhetorical wink for a probable presidential candidate visiting the first-in-nation caucus state. </s> <s> The audience of Iowans, who have become used to such bits, laughed knowingly. </s> <s> He took off for Florida that night. </s> <s> Christie ostensibly conducted this state-hopping tour in his role as head of the Republican Governors Association, a perch that has allowed him to spend much of the last year zipping around the country in a jet chartered by the governors association to support his party@-@s 35 gubernatorial candidates. </s> <s> He traveled incessantly for months, visiting nearly 20 states in October alone. </s> <s> On this Sunday in Florida, Christie had a few hours of down time amid six campaign events for Rick Scott, the state@-@s Republican governor. </s> <s> Christie requires little sleep @-@five or six hours, I@-@m solid@-@, but he appeared to be dragging. </s> <s> His eyes were sunken and dehydrated; his cheeks were flushed. </s> <s> It reminded me of how the governor often looks after he has been @-@on@-@ for long stretches: blowing out his cheeks, exhaling visibly and clenching whatever is nearby @-@the strap above the window of his Suburban, orangeade, a handful of nachos@-@ like a security blanket. </s> <s> The performative nature of Christie@-@s political style is exhausting. </s> <s> At his rallies for Scott, Christie would punctuate his remarks with a full-volume dismissal of Charlie Crist, Scott@-@s opponent, by thunderously declaring that his next job title would be @-@loser. </s> <s> @-@ @-@How do you know when Charlie Crist is lying? </s> <s> @-@ Christie said at a rally in Boca Raton. </s> <s> @-@His lips are moving. </s> <s> @-@ He engaged in long-distance snippiness with Kaci Hickox, the Ebola-treating nurse, who was threatening to sue over her quarantine. </s> <s> @-@Whatever, get in line,@-@ Christie said in response to a question about the suit. </s> <s> @-@I@-@ve been sued lots of times before. </s> <s> @-@ He had begun the morning by appearing on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace, his first Sunday performance of the year. </s> <s> Christie may have been exhausted, but he also conveyed an unmistakable air of satisfaction. </s> <s> In January, shortly after he cruised to re-election and was anointed the premature @-@early Republican front-runner@-@ for 2016, his career appeared to combust in full view. </s> <s> Several of his top aides had ordered the closing of two on-ramp lanes to the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, creating a four-day traffic jam in apparent retaliation for the refusal of the town@-@s mayor, a Democrat, to endorse Christie. </s> <s> As a political scandal, @-@bridge-gate@-@ @-@ or @-@the bridge thing,@-@ as Christie described it to me @-@ had so much going for it: It featured pileups of innocent victims, pettiness, hubris, betrayal, revenge, smoking guns and a spectacularly deflated governor in the middle of it all. </s> <s> Christie denied any involvement, but the episode seemed to cement an image of him as a petty tyrant. </s> <s> Suddenly, his future seemed in doubt. </s> <s> The governor seemed diminished; friends and associates described him as depressed and disengaged; he barely slept. </s> <s> @-@I became less trusting,@-@ he told me. </s> <s> At the same time, a number of damning newspaper and magazine profiles cataloged a history of cynical alliances and opportunism. </s> <s> Writing in The New Yorker, Ryan Lizza noted that Christie had made alliances with two influential New Jersey Democrats to ensure his comfortable re-election. </s> <s> One of them, he wrote, had been the subject on an investigation that Christie chose not to prosecute as the state@-@s United States attorney. </s> <s> After months of uncertain footing, though, Christie had charted an artful comeback, largely through the cover of his perch as chairman of the governors association. </s> <s> With the midterms approaching, and many of the tightest gubernatorial races breaking his way, Christie seemed to have reached a point where he fully believed he would survive politically. </s> <s> Now he could resume the daily pleasures of being Chris Christie, nachos foremost among them. </s> <s> He recently declared that he would @-@rather die@-@ than be in the United States Senate @-@Could you imagine me banging around that chamber with 99 other people? </s> <s> @-@ and went on to describe in expansive detail the act of drowning himself in the Potomac River, a classic act of self-effacement masking self-regard and one that implicitly ignored how, months earlier, he was flirting with his own political suicide. </s> <s> When I asked Christie if this bit had been a little excessive, he shrugged me off. </s> <s> @-@Forget it,@-@ he said. </s> <s> @-@I was having fun. </s> <s> I@-@m still allowed to have fun. </s> <s> @-@A waiter visited our table to inquire about the status of the nachos. </s> <s> @-@Are you still munchin@-@ on that? </s> <s> @-@ he asked. </s> <s> Christie nodded. </s> <s> There was work to be done. </s> <s> @-@I@-@m still munchin@-@ on it, baby,@-@ the governor said. </s> <s> @-@It@-@s so good, I gotta keep munchin@-@. </s> <s> @-@ The waiter headed off, and Christie pointed out the man@-@s array of tattoos, body piercings and blue baseball cap with a whorled design on the front. </s> <s> @-@That should be part of the story,@-@ he said. </s> <s> There are, in the public@-@s imagination, two competing notions of Chris Christie. </s> <s> In the first, he is a cravenly ambitious Everyman, a restless former lawyer and local officeholder who, through his law partner, became a major fund-raiser for George W. Bush and was named his campaign lawyer for New Jersey. </s> <s> This led to Christie@-@s appointment as United States attorney for the state, a post that, thanks to scores of high-profile cases involving corrupt politicians, propelled him to an unlikely victory over the incumbent governor, Jon Corzine, in 2009. </s> <s> In this vision of Christie, his love of the media spotlight is nearly Kardashianesque. </s> <s> Christie publicly flirted with a run for the White House in 2012; he didn@-@t mention Mitt Romney@-@s name until the 17th minute of his 24-minute keynote address at the Republican National Convention; weeks later, he infuriated his party by praising Barack Obama@-@s response to Hurricane Sandy. </s> <s> In the other persona, Christie is a cartoonish bully and a classic embodiment of New Jersey@-@s brawny ethnic politics. </s> <s> The state@-@s best-known national politicians have tended to be sober cerebral people in the tradition of Bill Bradley, Tom Kean and even Woodrow Wilson, but Christie seems to better resemble his state@-@s pop-culture powder kegs instead: that is, the Tony Sopranos, the Snookis and the Cake Bosses. </s> <s> In this vision of his character, Christie is an oversize figure of little substance, one whom Richard Ford recently referred to as the @-@candied-yam of a governor. </s> <s> @-@In person, Christie defies both of these caricatures. </s> <s> Obscured by the ambition, loose-cannon personality and, frankly, the girth, is the fact that he is an exceptionally gifted and nuanced politician. </s> <s> He has a preternatural talent for appearing blunt and insistent when he is being cute and obfuscating. </s> <s> He is also a savvy tactician. </s> <s> If Barack Obama were not a politician, you could imagine him being a law professor; Mitt Romney would be in business. </s> <s> If Christie were not a politician, he would be perfectly exhilarated to work as a political operative. </s> <s> Christie approached this story with the same shrewdness he brings to political life. </s> <s> A few months after @-@the bridge thing,@-@ I emailed Comella, asking to spend time with the governor for a profile. </s> <s> It was a Hail Mary query @-@Christie had mostly stopped sitting for print interviews@-@, but I was surprised when I was invited to lunch, in June, at the governor@-@s office in Trenton. </s> <s> Our lunch @-@ cold cuts, sliced tomatoes and potato chips @-@ was off the record, but I can divulge that it was typical of the subtext-free knowingness of how politics often works behind the scenes, even when the news media are involved. </s> <s> We knew what the other was doing and were both very open about it. </s> <s> I was trying to work Christie in hopes of getting a story; Christie was sizing me up, too. </s> <s> He knew that there was little, if any, upside in participating in a magazine profile at such a vulnerable moment. </s> <s> Even though the bridge scandal had receded, it still hung over the governor@-@s every move. </s> <s> New findings, revelations and even indictments could drop at any time. </s> <s> Despite all that, he was clearly intrigued. </s> <s> Christie seems very much to enjoy dances like this. </s> <s> He speaks in the clipped shorthand of the campaign managers, lobbyists and political pros who operate in state and national capitals. </s> <s> There is a cynical expression you hear around Washington, especially in lobbying circles, that someone @-@gets the joke@-@: They know the purpose of every situation and they know the angles, they know what people are doing and trying to do and they know how to do all this without looking as if they@-@re doing it. </s> <s> At that first meeting, Christie did not agree to be interviewed, but neither did he seem displeased when I suggested that I would be following him around through the summer and fall. </s> <s> Christie absolutely gets the joke. </s> <s> By then, the outlines of his comeback campaign were already beginning to take shape. </s> <s> It would involve a regiment of @-@safe@-@ and purposeful appearances, both at home and across the country. </s> <s> First, he would take hyperlocal visits across New Jersey: town-hall meetings, groundbreaking photo-ops and ceremonies to commemorate small-bore initiatives like boating safety. </s> <s> These visits would give him a chance to show that he cared about nontraditional Republican issues, like bail reform and drug rehab, in lieu of jail time, for addicts. </s> <s> He would follow up these performances with a heavy schedule of Republican Governors Association events where he could bank good will and cultivate donors while pounding away at easy targets, like Obama, Democratic opponents and the liberal-media vultures who, he believed, piled on after the bridge revelations. </s> <s> The genius of the tour was that it allowed Christie to work in the service of his colleagues and his party while first and foremost advancing himself. </s> <s> Christie@-@s plan was also calculated toward an even deeper, strategic purpose. </s> <s> Republicans have in recent elections nominated @-@establishment@-@ candidates @-@Romney, McCain, Bushes 43 and 41@-@, who make an implicit deal that they will portray themselves as @-@severely conservative,@-@ as Romney once called himself, in the primaries before eventually tacking back to the center in the summer. </s> <s> And while Christie@-@s anti-abortion, anti-gay-marriage and anti-tax stances make him conservative for New Jersey, he is certainly a moderate by the standards of evangelical conservatives, rural populists and gun activists who vote heavily in Republican primaries, especially in early states like Iowa and South Carolina. </s> <s> @-@Christie switched his position on abortion rights in 1996; he dropped his legal challenge to a court ruling that allowed same sex marriage in New Jersey last year. </s> <s> @-@ Christie@-@s nonstop traveling would bring him into contact with party leaders of a much more conservative stripe. </s> <s> The more chits Christie could collect with these conservative character witnesses @-@ bonus points if they had @-@governor@-@ in their titles @-@ the better his chances in a hypothetical primary. </s> <s> A few weeks after our lunch, I watched Christie preside over a town meeting in Caldwell, N. J., a suburb of New York City. </s> <s> @-@The fictional Soprano family resided in North Caldwell. </s> <s> @-@ Town meetings were the sites of several YouTube-ready encounters that built the mystique of his first term. </s> <s> The Caldwell town meeting, Christie@-@s 123rd as governor, was held in a room with lousy acoustics and filled with about 400 people who showed up to hear Christie talk about @-@hard truths. </s> <s> @-@ As he often does on the stump, Christie warned that if New Jersey did not reform spending, entitlements and taxes, the state would wind up like Detroit. </s> <s> @-@All you have to do is look to your west for an example of what@-@s in store,@-@ Christie said. </s> <s> After only a few minutes, a procession of individual protesters began making themselves known at synchronized intervals. </s> <s> This afforded Christie the chance to do what he does best: think on his feet and give the illusion of a simple, noble warrior, taking on all comers. </s> <s> Unlike news conferences and interviews, town meetings are typically pro-Christie crowds, and he can expect that his supporters will gang up on any interrogators. </s> <s> When a pink-haired woman read off a rant about education cuts, Christie immediately pounced. </s> <s> @-@If this is really so heartfelt, then why are you reading the talking points off the iPhone? </s> <s> @-@ Christie taunted. </s> <s> New Jersey, he said at one point, unrelated to anything, is a place that has @-@a little chip on its shoulder. </s> <s> @-@ A few moments later, he berated a sign-holding teacher from Newark who was shouting at him as she walked to the exit. </s> <s> @-@Show some respect,@-@ he said. </s> <s> The protester responded, @-@I@-@ll respect you if you respect me,@-@ and Christie@-@s face filled with a grin. </s> <s> He told me afterward, @-@We put on a good show for you, didn@-@t we? </s> <s> @-@ The next day he was off to the Jersey Shore to talk about boat safety. </s> <s> @-@Hey, great hat,@-@ Christie said as he saw me standing by the glass door in MJ@-@s Restaurant in Marion, Iowa. </s> <s> Christie was referring to my orange Steve DeBerg-era Tampa Bay Buccaneers cap that I bought a few years ago at an airport for no particular reason. </s> <s> Politicians often deploy one go-to icebreaker for every person they recognize: things like @-@How@-@s your mother doing? </s> <s> @-@ @-@if they had met her before@-@ or @-@Love your tie! </s> <s> @-@ @-@Bill Clinton is always complimenting ties@-@. </s> <s> @-@How@-@s the doctor? </s> <s> @-@ is the first thing Harry Reid asks when he sees me, referring to my wife, whom he met a long time ago and learned was a doctor. </s> <s> @-@He has no idea what her name is. </s> <s> @-@ Christie went for my Bucs cap. </s> <s> This trip to Iowa was his first open foray in months to an early primary or caucus state. </s> <s> It also coincided with the world@-@s exploding. </s> <s> That day, a Malaysia Airlines plane was apparently shot down over Ukraine, and Israel began an invasion of Gaza. </s> <s> Behind the counter at MJ@-@s, CNN was playing a split screen of both stories. </s> <s> Instead of going near these subjects, however, Christie was eager to tell everyone how he felt about Branstad: @-@a role model for me,@-@ @-@a dear friend,@-@ a @-@legend@-@ and @-@what public service is all about. </s> <s> @-@Christie@-@s roadshow was becoming treacherous. </s> <s> New Jersey suffered its sixth credit downgrade during his tenure, and he remained unable to fix the state@-@s pension plan. </s> <s> Atlantic City was dying in plain sight. </s> <s> Yet Christie was frequently out of the state, tending to his governors@-@ races or partaking in many of the celebrity events that grass-roots Republicans tend to deride, like the Bloomberg-Vanity Fair party after the White House Correspondents Dinner and the Allen @-@ Company conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. </s> <s> Weeks after citing an apocalyptic vision of Detroit in Caldwell, Christie flew to Michigan and praised Gov. </s> <s> Rick Snyder for exemplifying @-@what leadership can do@-@ for a big city. </s> <s> On international topics, he proved particularly ill adept, relying on broad criticisms of Obama@-@s inability to be @-@respected@-@ by Vladimir Putin and his own support for Israel. </s> <s> Christie was forced to apologize to Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire Republican donor, in Las Vegas after referring to the West Bank as @-@occupied territories,@-@ a term Adelson recoils from. </s> <s> Michael Barbaro, a reporter at The Times, quoted attendees panning Christie@-@s presentation at a confidential meeting of Republican donors and activists in Georgia last March. </s> <s> According to the article, Christie@-@s performance was @-@disturbingly heavy on swagger and light on substance. </s> <s> @-@ One source said his response to a question about Putin was @-@uncomfortable to watch. </s> <s> @-@Christie was particularly hard to pin down on immigration, one of the more divisive topics within the G. O. P. Earlier this year, he signed a New Jersey version of the so-called Dream Act, which ensured in-state tuition rates for the children of undocumented immigrants. </s> <s> Presumably, this would place him as a moderate within his party. </s> <s> But when he was asked about the subject on numerous occasions over the summer, he ducked and covered. </s> <s> @-@I@-@m not going to discuss a complicated issue like immigration here in Marion, Iowa,@-@ Christie said in the restaurant parking lot, employing a favorite tactic of name-dropping a random locale as a way to avoid talking about something important. </s> <s> @-@In New Hampshire, he shrugged off questions about ISIS by declaring, @-@I@-@m up in New Hampshire to talk about Walt Havenstein and why he@-@d be a great candidate for New Hampshire. </s> <s> @-@ @-@The country deserves a more deep and thoughtful conversation,@-@ Christie said. </s> <s> This was the backdrop of Christie@-@s imperfectly timed @-@trade mission@-@ to Mexico in early September. </s> <s> The trip was intended to signal the expansion of his policy repertoire and show that this famously undisciplined figure could behave in a diplomatic setting. </s> <s> Christie@-@s movements and events were heavily stage-managed. </s> <s> Before a photo-op lunch with the United States ambassador to Mexico, Earl Anthony Wayne, a Christie advance man gave the assembled diplomats detailed directions on protocol, where to stand and when to greet the governor. </s> <s> @-@You think we@-@ve done that before? </s> <s> @-@ Wayne joked to a colleague. </s> <s> She replied, @-@Once or twice. </s> <s> @-@ There was a media @-@war room@-@ at the Presidente Hotel. </s> <s> Someone had designed a fancy logo for the occasion, melding the Mexican and New Jersey flags. </s> <s> Christie told the traveling press corps that he would be doing @-@a great deal of listening@-@ on the trip, employing a related tactic of telling people what he is doing whether or not he is actually doing it. </s> <s> When I asked Christie why he always felt the need to tell people he was listening rather than simply listening, he said: @-@Because that@-@s who I am. </s> <s> Like, if I am doing something, unless I am really trying to be covert about it, I am going to tell you what I@-@m doing. </s> <s> @-@Christie performed his statesman duties without incident, although he often looked bored and distracted while doing his listening. </s> <s> During a ceremony to mark a new partnership at the country@-@s Education Ministry @-@like all partnerships, this one was @-@historic@-@, Christie fiddled with his translation headphones, whispered to the person sitting next to him and at one point literally twiddled his thumbs. </s> <s> As children performed a heartfelt re-enactment of Mexico@-@s history, Christie whispered into the ear of his new best friend, the governor of Puebla. </s> <s> During one conference breakfast, Christie punctuated an otherwise throwaway point with the ominous line, @-@This is the business we have chosen. </s> <s> @-@I immediately recalled it as a quote from @-@The Godfather II,@-@ when Hyman Roth offers his chilling assessment about turning the other cheek as his friend was murdered by his business partner. </s> <s> Christie cribs liberally from the @-@Godfather@-@ trilogy, and the original Brando version is his favorite movie. </s> <s> And while many politicians love the @-@Godfather@-@ movies, including Barack Obama, their Old World codes seem to reflect Christie@-@s approach to politics: his demand for total loyalty, his concern for respect, his love of the chess match and his long, exceptional memory. </s> <s> After the @-@bridge thing@-@ broke, Christie told me, there were people who disappointed him. </s> <s> He has not spoken to his former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, and campaign manager, Bill Stepien, since he fired them after their involvement became known. </s> <s> Christie remembers who piled on, who was silent and who @-@surprised@-@ him. </s> <s> @-@It was @-@educational,@-@ he said. </s> <s> He used to be a regular on @-@Morning Joe,@-@ the MSNBC morning show, and was pals with the co-hosts, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. </s> <s> But after bridge-gate, it became a feeding frenzy. </s> <s> @-@There@-@s an agenda at the network level at MSNBC,@-@ Christie told me. </s> <s> @-@All these folks have to march in line in order to keep their jobs. </s> <s> @-@ I asked Christie if he thought Scarborough and Brzezinski were taking orders from corporate bosses. </s> <s> @-@I don@-@t know,@-@ he said. </s> <s> @-@But it seems to me there is a completely different approach to me than they were approaching me in the past. </s> <s> @-@ @-@When I asked Scarborough if this was true, he said: @-@We saw him at the Vanity Fair-Bloomberg party last spring, and he stormed right past us. </s> <s> Mika and I just looked at each other and laughed. </s> <s> It@-@s a question of temperament with him. </s> <s> @-@ Yet Christie did not seem entirely displeased with this turn of events, either. </s> <s> Haley Barbour, the former governor of Mississippi and former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said, @-@A lot of people who vote in our primaries think that if MSNBC attacks you for a month, you must be better than I thought you were. </s> <s> @-@Christie also remembers those who were loyal. </s> <s> @-@When you@-@re in that position, whether it@-@s me or anybody else, you remember who was willing to stand up and defend you,@-@ Christie said. </s> <s> @-@Not because they knew every fact, because they didn@-@t.

Strain of the American Enterprise Institute. </s> <s> Specifically, several conservatives, including Conn Carroll of Townhall.com and Timothy P. Carney of The Washington Examiner, have called for a cut in the payroll tax, which helps pay for Medicare and Social Security. </s> <s> Though it receives less attention, 63 percent of taxpayers pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes. </s> <s> Policies aside, there is no question that the Republican candidates in 2016 will claim to be allies of the middle class. </s> <s> Mark Hemingway, of The Weekly Standard, wrote last week on Twitter that he worried about nominating Jeb Bush or Mitt Romney, because neither would easily be able @-@to run @-@hard@-@ against Hillary the elitist. </s> <s> @-@ Republicans with more of a middle-class image include Mr. Rubio and three Midwestern governors: John Kasich of Ohio, Mike Pence of Indiana and Scott Walker of Wisconsin. </s> <s> Stylistic appeals are nothing new, of course. </s> <s> @-@The new Republican Party I am speaking about,@-@ Ronald Reagan said, in 1977, @-@is going to have room for the man and the woman in the factories, for the farmer, for the cop on the beat. </s> <s> @-@ George W. Bush, in his 2000 convention speech, promised tax credits for low-income Americans. </s> <s> On cultural issues, like guns and abortion, the modern Republican Party has indeed pursued policies favored by large numbers of middle-income families. </s> <s> On economic issues, though, the party@-@s policies still summon the @-@country club-big business image@-@ that Mr. Reagan decried in 1977. </s> <s> Under the Reagan administration, the average total federal tax rate for the richest one-10,000th of taxpayers fell to 35 percent, from 60 percent. </s> <s> Mr. Bush@-@s administration did cut taxes for middle- and low-income families, but by vastly less than for the top 1 percent. </s> <s> The theory behind such tax cuts was always that they would help everyone, by lifting economic growth. </s> <s> It@-@s not a crazy theory, either. </s> <s> It just doesn@-@t seem to hold. </s> <s> The Reagan tax cuts may well have spurred growth, because they reduced rates from levels that today are unthinkably high. </s> <s> But the economy grew more slowly under Mr. Bush than under Bill Clinton or even Mr. Obama, both of whom raised taxes on the affluent. </s> <s> And perhaps more relevant than history, most Americans favor higher taxes on the well off, polls show. </s> <s> The question for Republicans in 2016 is whether to leave their economic approach largely unchanged and hope they can win anyway @-@ or to try something new. </s> <s> A payroll-tax cut would be one option. </s> <s> Another would be an income-tax cut focused on something other than the top marginal rate. </s> <s> Beyond taxes, the party could propose market-friendly ways to make college more affordable, such as changing accreditation rules, as Mr. Rubio favors. </s> <s> @-@The party that wins the next election,@-@ said Stuart Stevens, the longtime Republican consultant who was Mr. Romney@-@s chief strategist, @-@will be the one that speaks best to how to help people economically. </s> <s> @-@For now, the evidence of a new Republican approach is modest, but not absent. </s> <s> In 2012, Mr. Romney said he would not cut taxes for the affluent @-@although critics said that his numbers did not add up and that his plan might in fact reduce their taxes@-@. </s> <s> More recently, two different tax-overhaul plans @-@ one from Mr. Rubio and Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican; another from Representative Dave Camp, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee @-@ have paid considerable attention to middle-income families. </s> <s> Both plans would still benefit millionaires most, according to the Tax Policy Center. </s> <s> But they also contain ideas that don@-@t depend on high-end tax cuts. </s> <s> No matter what, Democrats are sure to paint Republicans as the party of the rich. </s> <s> For one thing, Democrats will be able to point out that the middle class and poor depend on government programs, like Medicare and Social Security, funded by tax dollars. </s> <s> But it would be a mistake to dismiss the intra-Republican debate as mere theater. </s> <s> Yes, government programs tend to help middle- and low-income families more than the rich. </s> <s> On the other hand, many government programs don@-@t work as well as they were meant to. </s> <s> There is certainly a coherent argument for letting the middle class and poor keep more of their income, rather than paying for inefficient government programs. </s> <s> It would be downright refreshing if some portion of the 2016 campaign revolved around that argument and the counterargument. </s> <s> After 15 years of slow-growing incomes, the country would have itself a presidential campaign reflecting economic realities. </s> <s> Frank BruniBy Frank Bruni@-@THE most interesting man in politics@-@ is what Politico

Rutherford, who led the project and is now dean of the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service, which is part of the Clinton Center. </s> <s> Mr. Clinton had such an active role in the establishment of his library that the exhibit designer Ralph Appelbaum called him @-@our curator in chief and even our art director at times. </s> <s> @-@ The former president wanted the edifice to resemble the library at Trinity College in Dublin, though locals have said @-@affectionately@-@ that the building looks more like a mobile home perched over the Arkansas River. </s> <s> Stephanie S. Streett, the executive director of the library and former director of scheduling in the White House, made an extra effort to encourage guests to attend the anniversary festivities, which officially span 10 days with discussions and events all over town, including a requisite screening of the 1993 documentary @-@The War Room@-@ about the Clinton-Gore campaign. </s> <s> Three panel discussions on Friday will coincide with the release of an independent oral history of the Clinton White House put out by the Miller Center at the University of Virginia. </s> <s> The library@-@s more than 35,000 cubic feet of archival material, including 80 million documents, 20 million emails and two million photographs, have been particularly pored over, given the possibility of Mrs. Clinton running. </s> <s> The Arkansas Travelers, a cohort of locals who traveled the country to campaign for Mr. Clinton in 1992, will join out-of-town supporters and are not shy about pledging their support again in 2016, though several said they would enlist their grandchildren to do the traveling this time. </s> <s> The nostalgia for the 1990s that will be on display in Little Rock may not be as valuable on the campaign trail in 2016. </s> <s> Many of the midterm candidates the Clintons campaigned for this year were defeated. </s> <s> Arkansas delivered particular disappointments to Mr. Clinton, who campaigned frequently for the incumbent Democrat, Senator Mark Pryor, who lost to Representative Tom Cotton by 17 percentage points. </s> <s> Still, advisers said fondness for the Clinton years, particularly among the white working-class voters who have long identified with Mr. Clinton@-@s Southern roots and centrist politics, can only help should Mrs. Clinton run. </s> <s> During the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, when her rivals accused her of relying too heavily on her husband@-@s record, Mrs. Clinton would often respond: @-@I always wonder what part of the 1990s they didn@-@t like: the peace or the prosperity? </s> <s> @-@Despite speculation about 2016, the official lineup for the weekend will be focused on the Clinton Center, the work of the Clinton Foundation and Mr. Clinton@-@s legacy. </s> <s> @-@There will be more nostalgia and talk of the good old days@-@ than of what@-@s next, said Thomas F. McLarty III, a White House chief of staff to Mr. Clinton. </s> <s> @-@He@-@ll have created 28 million new jobs rather than 22 million by the time the weekend@-@s over. </s> <s> @-@The Club for Growth PAC is already backing candidates in the 2016 election, but not that 2016 election. </s> <s> The anti-tax group is endorsing six senators for re-election two years from now, all of them Republicans who won their seats as part of the Tea Party wave of 2010: Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Lee of Utah,@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@@-@ Rand Paul of Kentucky, Marco Rubio of Florida, Tim Scott of South Carolina and Patrick J.

electorate is the result of@-@ President Obama@-@s unique appeal. </s> <s> This is a topic that will get a far deeper treatment in time, but for now, we can say that the preponderance of data on demographics and turnout suggests that voters will be at least as diverse as they were in 2012, when Mr. Obama won re-election. </s> <s> The reason for such confidence? </s> <s> The data on turnout and demographics suggests that the growing nonwhite share of the electorate is primarily the result of demographics, not enthusiasm for Mr. Obama. </s> <s> The white share of eligible voters has declined from above 75 percent in 2004 to 70 percent today. </s> <s> That five-point drop-off mirrors the 5.5-point decline in the white share of the electorate over the same period. </s> <s> The white share of eligible voters will most likely slip further, to under 69 percent in 2016. </s> <s> The result is that the electorate will probably be as diverse as it was in 2012, even if nonwhite turnout rates drop and white turnout increases. </s> <s> That@-@s not to say that Mr. Obama didn@-@t drive turnout higher, particularly among black voters. </s> <s> But even there, the contribution of Mr. Obama is smaller than one might expect. </s> <s> Sixty percent of eligible black voters turned out in 2004, compared with 66 percent in 2012. </s> <s> There are a few confounding issues that will receive more attention in later posts, like the effect of the youth of the nonwhite population, which would tend to suppress nonwhite turnout rates, and the effect of an aging white population, which would tend to boost white turnout. </s> <s> But youth turnout was not particularly high in 2012, and that alone would not be enough to offset the steady diversification of the pool of eligible voters.

2012, he became the nation@-@s first governor to survive a recall election. </s> <s> On Tuesday, Mr. Walker beat Mary Burke, a Democrat who was little known statewide until recently and whose only previous campaign had been for a seat on Madison@-@s school board. </s> <s> In a rousing 10-minute victory speech, Mr. Walker described the challenges of the past few months, as well as those of the past few years, seemingly referring to his battle with the unions and the subsequent recall. </s> <s> @-@There was a group out of Washington @-@ Washington-based special interests @-@ who thought they

something not against something, and look what happened,@-@ he said. </s> <s> The race, which had been extremely close for months, was largely a referendum on Mr. Walker and a first term that brought sweeping changes to Wisconsin. </s> <s> Since 2011, when Mr. Walker took office and Republicans won control of both chambers of the State Legislature, Wisconsin voters have been split over policy shifts that began with cuts to collective bargaining rights for most public workers. </s> <s> Mr. Walker and his colleagues went on to cut taxes, expand school vouchers, permit concealed weapons and limit early voting. </s> <s> In a state traditionally accustomed to polite negotiation across party lines, some in Wisconsin said residents over the past four years seemed more divided than ever. </s> <s> Democratic lawmakers fled the state at one point in an effort to block the vote on union bargaining rights, recall elections were held for officeholders from both parties, and families and friends chose sides @-@ sometimes opposing ones. </s> <s> Mr. Walker@-@s push to cut bargaining rights and to require most public sector workers to pay more for their health care and pensions drew tens of thousands of protesters to Madison, the state capital, in early 2011. </s> <s> But in recent months, the state@-@s economy was the single largest focus of the governor@-@s race. </s> <s> Mr. Walker promised to bring 250,000 new jobs to the state during his first term, but fewer than half that have materialized. </s> <s> Ms. Burke laid out an economic plan, @-@Invest for Success,@-@ but the document caused embarrassment when it was discovered that portions of it were exactly the same as sections of other economic plans from candidates in other states. </s> <s> Ms. Burke@-@s campaign soon said it had cut ties with a consultant who had worked on the other races. </s> <s> Through the campaign, Ms. Burke, 55, portrayed herself as a clear alternative to Mr. Walker. </s> <s> She said she would bring to state government her business expertise, which includes a degree from Harvard Business School and time as an executive at Trek Bicycle Corporation, a company founded by her father. </s> <s> Mr. Walker, 47, served as a state lawmaker before becoming the Milwaukee County executive, then governor. </s> <s> At times, criminal investigations @-@ one related to activity in the county executive@-@s office, the other to possible collaboration between conservative groups and his campaign during the recall effort @-@ have clouded his political future. </s> <s> But he was not charged in either investigation. </s> <s> Just after Mr. Walker won the recall election, Republicans began mentioning him among a list of possible candidates for president in 2016. </s> <s> Mr. Walker@-@s success at pushing through a conservative agenda, then surviving a recall challenge in a state that twice favored President Obama gave him a r@-@sum@-@ Republicans saw as appealing for a White House run. </s> <s> Yet Mr. Walker needed to win a second term as governor on Tuesday to remain viable in that regard, and some political analysts said a decisive margin of victory was needed to bolster the case for a future presidential run. </s> <s> Political CalculusBy Nate CohnWhatever doubts existed about the Republican grip on the House should now be gone. </s> <s> By picking up at least a dozen House seats in the elections last Tuesday, the Republicans cemented a nearly unassailable majority that could last for a generation, or as long as today@-@s political divides between North and South, urban and rural, young and old, and white and nonwhite endure. </s> <s> Democrats might well reclaim the Senate and hold the presidency in 2016. </s> <s> But any Democratic hopes of enacting progressive policies on issues like climate change and inequality will face the reality of a House dominated by conservative Republicans. </s> <s> The odds that the Republicans will hold the Senate and seize the presidency are better than the odds that Democrats will win the House, giving the Republicans a better chance than Democrats of enacting their agenda. </s> <s> After all of the remaining races are resolved, the G. O. P. will finish with about 249 seats. </s> <s> The Democrats would need to flip 32 seats to reclaim the chamber, but just 10 Republicans hail from districts with a Democratic Cook partisan voting index, a statistic to measure how far a congressional district leans toward the Republican or Democratic Party, compared with the national average. </s> <s> Because so many Republicans represent conservative districts, the G. O. P. might even retain the House in a @-@wave@-@ election, like the ones that swept Democrats to power in 2006 and brought Republicans back to power in 2010. </s> <s> The Republican grip on the House is underpinned by the tendency for Democrats to waste votes in heavily urban or nonwhite districts; the low Democratic turnout in off-year elections; the recent Democratic advantage in presidential elections; the advantages of incumbency; and partisan gerrymandering. </s> <s> Ending partisan gerrymandering would not be enough to end the Republican advantage in the House, and last Tuesday@-@s results for state legislatures and for governors@-@ races further strengthened the Republicans@-@ ability to control the redistricting process. </s> <s> The median House seat is held by a Republican who represents a district that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, even in a year in which President Obama won by four percentage points nationally. </s> <s> The Republicans hold only 28 seats in districts that were carried by Mr. Obama. </s> <s> Many of these seats would fall to the Democrats in an anti-Republican year. </s> <s> The 12 newly elected Republicans who won seats in districts carried by Mr. Obama in 2012 are particularly vulnerable; many of these freshman Republicans could lose re-election in 2016. </s> <s> Yet Democrats will have a struggle to win all of the seats held by Republicans that voted for Mr. Obama in 2012. </s> <s> The benefits of incumbency will allow many of these Republicans to defy even the most inhospitable conditions. </s> <s> And some of these Republicans, like Dave Reichert of Washington or Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey, are survivors of the 2006 and 2008 waves. </s> <s> To gauge the problem for Democrats, look at the Cook partisan voting index, which measures districts by presidential votes. </s> <s> @-@A district with a D@-@5 P. V. I., for instance, has offered the Democratic presidential candidate a share of the popular vote 5 percentage points higher than the national average over the last two presidential elections. </s> <s> @-@ If a future Democratic wave were to flip Republican-held seats at the same rate as the Democratic wave in 2006 or the Republican one in 2010 @-@that is, win about 30 percent of the R@-@3 seats, and 25 percent of the R@-@4 seats@-@, they would gain about 27 seats @-@ short of the 32 necessary to retake the House. </s> <s> Democrats could do even better in the D@-@1-or-better seats than this scenario projects, but they could also do worse among the seats with a P. V. I. of R@-@6 or more Republican, where the estimate assumes the Democrats would win four seats. </s> <s> Republicans didn@-@t win a single seat that was so Democratic in 2010, and the big gains that Democrats made among these seats in 2006 were driven by problems among Republicans who were accused of corruption. </s> <s> Even if the Democrats could retake the House in an anti-Republican wave, it probably won@-@t come with a Democratic president to take advantage of it. </s> <s> The party with the presidency rarely makes big gains in Congress. </s> <s> As my colleague Lynn Vavreck put it, the economy elects presidents; presidents elect Congress. </s> <s> In other words, a Republican president is probably a prerequisite to a Democratic House. </s> <s> And even a Republican president might not assure another wave like 2006 or 2010, which itself would not even assure a Democratic House. </s> <s> Midterm CalculusBy Amanda Cox and Nate CohnOn election night, knowing who is ahead isn@-@t enough. </s> <s> In states like Virginia, Georgia and elsewhere, cities have traditionally been among the last to report their votes. </s> <s> Because cities lean Democratic, this pattern means that returns for Democratic candidates will appear weaker than they actually are for a few hours after the polls close. </s> <s> Similarly, in states with slow-counting Republican areas, Republican candidates will seem weaker than they actually are. </s> <s> The worst election analysts use these changes to tell comeback stories, asserting that a candidate was trailing early in the night but made up ground. </s> <s> More sophisticated analysts interpret leads through the lens of the outstanding votes. </s> <s> @-@There@-@s a lot of votes left to be counted in heavily Democratic Cuyahoga County,@-@ Jeff Greenfield said on CNN in 2004. </s> <s> @-@Remember, some of the votes outstanding are down here in Marion County where Obama is winning,@-@ John King said on the same network in 2008. </s> <s> This year, The Upshot will aim to let you be your own John King. </s> <s> In about a dozen of the closest Senate races, we, like many others, will track the leads reported by The Associated Press. </s> <s> But we will also adjust those leads based on what we know about where the votes have come from. </s> <s> Our adjusted leads will be based solely on current and historical returns. </s> <s> They will not use data from exit polls, or any forecasts from Senate models. </s> <s> You@-@ll be able to find a link to the tracker on The Times@-@s midterm page and The Upshot@-@s home page. </s> <s> Here@-@s what The Upshot@-@s adjustment would have looked like in the contest between President Obama and Mitt Romney in Virginia in 2012. </s> <s> At 10 p.m., with about 75 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Obama trailed Mr. Romney by a few percentage points. </s> <s> Some people following only the raw vote totals came to believe that Mr. Romney had a good chance to win the state. </s> <s> In truth, it was unlikely that Mr. Romney@-@s lead would hold, because counties like Alexandria, Arlington and Fairfax @-@ containing Democratic-leaning Washington suburbs @-@ had many votes outstanding. </s> <s> The Upshot@-@s adjusted lead would have anticipated these votes, and would have been relatively stable by that time. </s> <s> @-@If our adjusted lead were perfectly clairvoyant, the line would have been flat. </s> <s> @-@To create the adjusted series, we need to estimate two things: the number of votes left and their partisan split. </s> <s> For the votes left, we make an educated guess based on neighboring counties where vote counting is complete. </s> <s> If turnout in a region is down 10 percent from an initial baseline, we assume turnout in a county in that region will be down by the same amount, until it proves otherwise. </s> <s> When the county finishes reporting, we update our prediction for the region as a whole. </s> <s> We perform a similar calculation for how the votes will be split. </s> <s> If a region has shifted a few percentage points toward the Republicans relative to a previous election in the state, we assume the county will, too. </s> <s> In addition to the shift since the previous election, our baseline guesses are adjusted for demographic changes since that election. </s> <s> This method will not be perfect. </s> <s> In the Republican primary runoff in Mississippi in June, we were surprised by turnout in a series of counties that reported results about 10 p.m. With around 80 percent of the vote reported, our estimate of the difference between Senator Thad Cochran and his opponent, Chris McDaniel, shifted by a percentage point, toward Mr. McDaniel @-@ a sizable amount that late in the night. </s> <s> You can expect our adjusted returns to move, because no one has perfect information about the size or makeup of the outstanding vote. </s> <s> We are particularly concerned this year about early voters in states like Iowa and North Carolina. </s> <s> @-@Counties report early votes in various ways: early or late, together or separate. </s> <s> @-@We are also concerned about turnout efforts isolated in particular parts of a state and about contests without an obvious historical baseline, like a contest in Kentucky in an era when Democrats are increasingly unpopular in coal country, as well as a race in Kansas involving an independent candidate. </s> <s> For these reasons, and others, adjusted leads can@-@t and shouldn@-@t be used to make projections. </s> <s> In a very close race, there are too

immediate future, is probably the oldest and most obvious play in the book: a tax cut. </s> <s> A few years ago, a middle-class tax cut would have seemed a silly idea. </s> <s> Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama had already cut taxes, and the federal budget deficit was enormous. </s> <s> But the deficit has since fallen sharply, thanks in part to lower health costs. </s> <s> Meanwhile, middle- and lower-income families are reaping a disproportionately small share of economic growth. </s> <s> Having the government try to rectify the situation doesn@-@t sound so silly now @-@ and probably won@-@t in the 2016 presidential campaign. </s> <s> Obviously, a tax cut doesn@-@t need to be a Democratic idea. </s> <s> If anything, it@-@s traditionally been more of a Republican one. </s> <s> But Republicans@-@ first priority tends to be cutting the top marginal tax rate or the corporate tax rate, changes that mostly benefit the affluent households already doing pretty well. </s> <s> @-@And history is clear that such tax cuts rarely bring the economic benefits their advocates claim. </s> <s> @-@Any presidential candidate @-@ from either party @-@ who can claim the mantle of middle-class tax cutter is likely to benefit from it. </s> <s> For that matter, you could imagine Mr. Obama or reform-minded Republicans in Congress proposing such a tax cut sooner. </s> <s> The details could be straightforward. </s> <s> The cut could be temporary or permanent. </s> <s> It could involve a decline in marginal tax rates for the middle class or an expansion of tax credits. </s> <s> Mr. Sperling, for example, has suggested giving middle-class and poor families some of the same tax incentives to save for retirement that wealthy people have. </s> <s> Any one of these plans would raise people@-@s effective income in a tangible way. </s> <s> Because the long-term budget deficit remains a problem, any such tax cut could be paired with a tax increase for top earners, who @-@ even after the expiration of some Bush-era tax cuts @-@ still face lower rates than they have for most of recent history. </s> <s> @-@Taxes for high-earning Americans are too low,@-@ argues Roger Altman, the Wall Street executive and Democratic adviser. </s> <s> Most Americans favor tax increases on the well-off, polls show. </s> <s> The model for such a combination, and for winning the political debate over it, is Mr. Obama@-@s 2008 presidential campaign. </s> <s> He proposed higher taxes on top earners along with a larger middle-class tax cut than Senator John McCain, his opponent, did. </s> <s> By the

CohnAfter five of six presidential elections in which the Republicans have lost the popular vote, this year@-@s midterm elections point toward a plausible Republican path to winning the White House. </s> <s> The Democratic losses were not simply because of low turnout. </s> <s> Republicans often made significant gains among rural, white voters. </s> <s> Some candidates made inroads among young and Hispanic voters, as well, according to exit polls and county and precinct-level results. </s> <s> But the Republican path is also narrow, one the Democrats could block if they reassemble their support among the young, nonwhite and suburban voters whom President Obama won in 2008 and 2012. </s> <s> In the simplest of terms, Republicans made progress this year toward solving their demographic problems, but not enough. </s> <s> @-@It was an excellent election night,@-@ said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster, @-@but it doesn@-@t solve our problem in demographics in presidential years. </s> <s> @-@The results in Iowa were the clearest illustration that the Republican landslide on Tuesday was not just because of low Democratic turnout in off-year elections. </s> <s> On Tuesday, Joni Ernst, now a Republican senator-elect, won a decisive nine-point victory. </s> <s> She swept much of traditionally Democratic eastern Iowa, where Democrats have long fared well with rural voters. </s> <s> In Colorado, Cory Gardner, now a senator-elect, also made significant gains among rural white voters. </s> <s> He also outperformed past Republicans in traditionally Democratic, heavily Hispanic counties. </s> <s> These gains suggest that demographic trends have not doomed Republicans to minority-party status, as some political analysts predicted. </s> <s> Those predictions hinged in part on the assumption that Democrats could fare no worse among white voters than Mr. Obama. </s> <s> That assumption ignored Mr. Obama@-@s strengths among white voters outside the South. </s> <s> Whether the coalition that Mr. Obama assembled in 2008 and 2012 can be remobilized in 2016, without Mr. Obama on the ballot, is a big question. </s> <s> But Tuesday contained enough good news for Democrats, obscured by their many defeats, that it would be unwise for Republicans to assume that the coalition cannot be rebuilt. </s> <s> Democrats would have narrowly won key races in Colorado and North Carolina if the electorate were as young and diverse as it was in 2012, and as Democrats hope it will be in 2016. </s> <s> It could be even more diverse, given the powerful demographic forces underlying the growth of the nonwhite share of the electorate over the last decade. </s> <s> Democrats also maintained most of their support among college-educated whites and black voters, a combination that would make it hard for Republicans to win 2016. </s> <s> Yet the Republicans still made meaningful gains, enough to turn some states red if they could be replicated in two years. </s> <s> Their main challenge is to find ways to extend those gains over the next two years, and especially to replicate their gains with white voters in 2014 among other groups. </s> <s> It may seem unlikely that future Republican presidential candidates could do better among white voters than Mitt Romney did against Mr. Obama. </s> <s> The national exit polls showed that Mr. Obama received just 39 percent of the white vote in 2012, the lowest since Walter Mondale in 1984. </s> <s> Yet Mr. Obama@-@s weakness was almost entirely attributable to white voters in the South and Appalachia. </s> <s> Outside of those regions, Mr. Obama fared well among white voters. </s> <s> He was a strong candidate among white voters across much of the northern half of the country, easily winning overwhelmingly white states like New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa. </s> <s> It is not obvious that future Democrats can count on repeating Mr. Obama@-@s strength among Northern white voters. </s> <s> Not only did Mr. Obama run ahead of past Democrats, he defeated Hillary Rodham Clinton in many of these regions in the 2008 primaries. </s> <s> The next Republican presidential candidate could outperform Mr. Romney among white voters by holding Republican gains in the South and winning back some of the white Obama voters of the rural North. </s> <s> Many analysts have assumed that the next Democratic candidate, perhaps Mrs. Clinton, will be able to both maintain the support of these Northern rural voters and outperform Mr. Obama among Southern white voters, perhaps by a significant margin. </s> <s> Yet none of the strong Democratic Senate candidates in the South @-@ Mary L. Landrieu, Alison Lundergan Grimes, Michelle Nunn, Kay Hagan, Mark Pryor and Mark Warner @-@ did significantly better among white voters than Mr. Obama. </s> <s> This pattern deals a blow to Democratic hopes of competing in Georgia in 2016, a state they had hoped would follow Virginia@-@s and North Carolina@-@s path and become a swing state. </s> <s> But if Iowa gives Republicans their biggest reason for hope, Colorado and North Carolina offer reasons for caution, even though Republicans won Senate seats in both. </s> <s> In those two states, the Republican victories appeared to rely on low turnout, and Democrats fared very well among college-educated white voters. </s> <s> In Colorado, Senator Mark Udall, a Democrat, lost by two points in a state that Mr. Obama won by five points. </s> <s> But Mr. Udall ran what was widely considered to be a mediocre campaign, focused relentlessly on Mr. Gardner@-@s past support for a @-@personhood@-@ amendment that would confer constitutional rights at conception. </s> <s> Had young voters and registered Democrats turned out at the rates they did in 2012, Mr. Udall would likely be looking forward to another term, according to an Upshot analysis of voter file data from the Colorado secretary of state. </s> <s> Mr. Udall maintained nearly all of Mr. Obama@-@s support among college-educated white voters. </s> <s> He even outperformed Mr. Obama among college-educated white voters, according to exit polls. </s> <s> Jefferson County, a suburban county consisting mainly of well-educated white voters west of Denver, and a bellwether in statewide elections, went to Mr. Udall, narrowly. </s> <s> The story was similar in North Carolina, where Ms. Hagan also ran ahead of Mr. Obama among college-educated white voters, according to the exit polls. </s> <s> Ms. Hagan posted a better showing in Orange County, which includes Chapel Hill, and in Durham than any Democratic presidential candidate since Franklin D. Roosevelt, winning 75 percent of the vote. </s> <s> The Republicans could fail to capitalize on the opportunities presented by Mr. Obama@-@s unpopularity; some are already interpreting the lower nonwhite and youth turnout rates of 2014 as evidence that Democrats cannot mobilize nonwhite voters without Mr. Obama on the ballot. </s> <s> However, there is a tendency for nonwhite and young voters to turn out at lower rates in midterm elections than in presidential elections. </s> <s> Last week@-@s results suggest that Republicans would be taking a big risk if they count on nonwhite turnout falling so low again. </s> <s> The vaunted Democratic mobilization effort did not replicate the 2012 electorate @-@ something it could never do given the tendency for nonwhite and young voters to stay home @-@ but it did produce a notably more Democratic electorate in states like North Carolina and Colorado than in 2010. </s> <s> The effectiveness of the Democratic turnout effort is perhaps best illustrated by contrasting those states with Virginia, where Mr. Warner nearly lost a state where he was thought to be safe. </s> <s> Democrats did not invest heavily in field operations in Virginia, and turnout was far lower than the other battlegrounds, particularly in the most Democratic precincts and jurisdictions. </s> <s> There is no way to be sure that the Democrats will remobilize young and nonwhite voters in 2016, even if it is the outcome most consistent with the available data on turnout and demographics. </s> <s> But if they do, the Republicans may need to perform still better in 2016 than they did last week. </s> <s> Letter From WashingtonBy Albert R.

race in no small part because he is extremely strong among people on the periphery of the G. O. P. coalition. </s> <s> He is strongest among Republicans who are less affluent, less educated and less likely to turn out to vote. </s> <s> His very best voters are self-identified Republicans who nonetheless are registered as Democrats. </s> <s> It@-@s a coalition that@-@s concentrated in the South, Appalachia and the industrial North, according to data provided to The Upshot by Civis Analytics, a Democratic data firm. </s> <s> Mr. Trump@-@s huge advantage among these groups poses a challenge for his campaign, because it may not have the turnout operation necessary to mobilize irregular voters. </s> <s> But it is just as big a challenge for the Republican Party, which has maintained its competitiveness in spite of losses among nonwhite and young voters by adding older and white voters, many from the South. </s> <s> These gains have helped the party retake the House, the Senate and many state governments. </s> <s> But these same voters may now be making it harder for the party to broaden its appeal to nonwhite and younger people @-@ perhaps even by helping to nominate Mr. Trump. </s> <s> The Civis estimates are based on interviews with more than 11,000 Republican-leaning respondents since August. </s> <s> The large sample, combined with statistical modeling techniques, presents the most detailed examination yet of the contours of Mr. Trump@-@s unusual coalition. </s> <s> The estimates reflect the race as it was on Dec. 21, when Mr. Trump led a surging Ted Cruz, 33 percent to 20 percent. </s> <s> The modeled estimates do not include people who are undecided, so all of the tallies are modestly higher than they would be if the survey were reporting the unmodeled results with undecided voters. </s> <s> Perhaps above all else, the data shows that Mr. Trump has broad support in the G. O. P., spanning all major demographic groups. </s> <s> He leads among Republican women and among people in well-educated and affluent areas. </s> <s> He even holds a nominal lead among Republican respondents that Civis estimated are Hispanic, based on their names and where they live. </s> <s> But Mr. Trump@-@s lead is not equal among all G. O. P. groups, or across all parts of the country. </s> <s> His support follows a clear geographic pattern. </s> <s> He fares best in a broad swath of the country stretching from the Gulf Coast, up the spine of the Appalachian Mountains, to upstate New York. </s> <s> Mr. Trump@-@s best state is West Virginia, followed by New York. </s> <s> Eight of Mr. Trump@-@s 10 best congressional districts are in New York, including several on Long Island. </s> <s> North Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Louisiana and South Carolina follow. </s> <s> His strength in the South is blunted only by Ted Cruz in Texas and Mike Huckabee in Arkansas. </s> <s> @-@Mr. Huckabee, despite his weakness nationally, still holds a lead in the congressional district of his Arkansas hometown. </s> <s> @-@ Mr. Trump fares well in Florida despite the political histories of Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio in the state. </s> <s> The margin of uncertainty around the congressional district estimates is plus or minus 8.7 percentage points, even after more than 11,000 interviews and the benefit of modeling. </s> <s> The data also reflects the preferences of Republican 2016 general election voters @-@ a smaller group than all registered voters, but larger than a primary or caucus electorate. </s> <s> The broad pattern in the Civis data is still clear, however. </s> <s> Mr. Trump@-@s strength fades as one heads west. </s> <s> Nearly all of his weakest states @-@ 16 of his worst 19 @-@ lie west of the Mississippi. </s> <s> Mr. Trump@-@s struggles in Iowa might not reflect a challenge specific to the state; it may simply be the only state from the Great Plains or Mountain West where public pollsters frequently conduct public opinion surveys. </s> <s> His worst is Utah, a traditionally Republican and affluent state. </s> <s> His geographic pattern of support is not just about demographics @-@ educational attainment, for example. </s> <s> It is not necessarily the typical pattern for a populist, either. </s> <s> In fact, it@-@s almost the exact opposite of Ross Perot@-@s support in 1992, which was strongest in the West and New England, and weakest in the South and industrial North. </s> <s> But it is still a familiar pattern. </s> <s> It is similar to a map of the tendency toward racism by region, according to measures like the prevalence of Google searches for racial slurs and racist jokes, or scores on implicit association tests. </s> <s> @-@This type of animus towards African-Americans is far more common than just about anyone would have guessed,@-@ said Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, the economist who first used Google search data to measure racial animus and argued that Barack Obama lost four percentage points in 2008 because of racial animus @-@a number I have argued is too high@-@. </s> <s> He is now a contributing op-ed writer at The New York Times. </s> <s> Racially charged searches take place everywhere @-@ they are about as common as searches for @-@The Daily Show@-@ or the Los Angeles Lakers. </s> <s> But they are more common in some parts of the country than others. </s> <s> That Mr. Trump@-@s support is strong in similar areas does not prove that most or even many of his supporters are motivated by racial animus. </s> <s> But it is consistent with the possibility that at least some are. </s> <s> The same areas where racial animus is highest in the Google data also tend to have older and less educated people, and Mr. Trump tends to fare better among those groups @-@ though the effect of Google data remains just as strong after controlling for these other factors. </s> <s> These areas also include many of the places where Democrats have lost the most ground over the last half-century, and where Hillary Clinton tended to fare best among white voters in her contest against Mr. Obama in the 2008 Democratic primaries. </s> <s> In many of these areas, a large number of traditionally Democratic voters have long supported Republicans in presidential elections. </s> <s> Even now, Democrats have more registered voters than Republicans do in states like West Virginia and Kentucky, which have been easily carried by Republicans in every presidential contest of this century. </s> <s> As recently as a few years ago, Democrats still had a big advantage in partisan self-identification in the same states. </s> <s> But during the Obama era, many of these voters have abandoned the Democrats. </s> <s> Many Democrats may now even identify as Republicans, or as independents who lean Republican, when asked by pollsters @-@ a choice that means they@-@re included in a national Republican primary survey, whether they remain registered as Democrats or not. </s> <s> Mr. Trump appears to hold his greatest strength among people like these @-@ registered Democrats who identify as Republican leaners @-@ with 43 percent of their support, according to the Civis data. </s> <s> Similarly, many of Mr. Trump@-@s best states are those with a long tradition of Democrats who vote Republican in presidential elections, like West Virginia. </s> <s> Mr. Trump@-@s strength among traditionally Democratic voters could pose some problems for his campaign. </s> <s> Many states bar voters registered with the other party from participating in partisan primaries. </s> <s> Other states go further, not allowing unaffiliated voters to vote in a primary; in the G. O.

of Fame equestrian rider, helped the family with money he made performing at Madison Square Garden and training Olympic show-jumping horses. </s> <s> After graduation from Catholic school in Park Slope, she studied in Tennessee, became engaged to David Driscoll at 18, went back to Brooklyn, followed her husband to Virginia and fell in love with the idea of Vermont, which she had been reading about in the self-sufficiency magazine Mother Earth News. </s> <s> In addition to their own children, the couple took in foster children, which strained the marriage and helped lead to a divorce. </s> <s> Ms. Sanders became a community organizer and met Phil Fiermonte, who remains a key member of Mr. Sanders@-@s team. </s> <s> She joined Mr. Sanders@-@s inner circle herself, after meeting him during his victorious insurgent@-@ campaign for mayor of Burlington in 1981. </s> <s> They began dating and she ended up running the city@-@s youth office. </s> <s> @-@She was involved all the way through,@-@ said Kathy Lawrence, who used to work for Ms. Sanders in the youth office. </s> <s> @-@They had long days and then out to meetings at night. </s> <s> @-@With an abundance of wavy red hair and conviction, she shared the mayor@-@s temperament and relished the political heft afforded by City Hall, even on issues seemingly peripheral to municipal governance. </s> <s> She berated city

the Soviet Union, Burlington@-@s sister city. </s> <s> The trip @-@ which the couple jokingly referred to as a honeymoon @-@ has become something of a punch line for Republican candidates who accuse Mr. Sanders of Bolshevism. </s> <s> Ms. Sanders has also seemed to have fun with the idea. </s> <s> In August 1988, she jokingly responded to an inquiry to her office about Russian-language courses,

</s> <s> Slouching and noticeably dyspeptic, Kasich waited for her to finish. </s> <s> His reply was one he@-@d given to reporters a half-dozen times already that day. </s> <s> @-@Look, I don@-@t spend any time thinking about him,@-@ he said. </s> <s> @-@I don@-@t take this seriously. </s> <s> @-@ His focus was on making his case to the voters of New Hampshire, the state where Kasich was investing inordinate energy in hopes of staging an upset victory over Trump, who was then polling ahead of everyone else by double digits. </s> <s> He did say of Trump: @-@I don@-@t like people who call other people names. </s> <s> I don@-@t like the divisiveness. </s> <s> I don@-@t like the negativity. </s> <s> @-@ After that, he declared himself done with the topic and scanned the audience for another question. </s> <s> Later that day, over lunch with Kasich at an Italian restaurant in Manchester, I expressed skepticism that he could so easily dismiss the man who had dominated the Republican field for the past five months. </s> <s> @-@I don@-@t care what the polls say,@-@ he snapped. </s> <s> @-@Look. </s> <s> There@-@s going to be a vote coming up. </s> <s> And then we don@-@t have to have this discussion anymore. </s> <s> @-@When I last saw Kasich, in September, he seemed quite taken with the state of the race, because some recent polls showed him in second place in New Hampshire, trailing only Trump. </s> <s> Back then, the assumption held by every rival campaign and nearly every political commentator was that Republican voters would weary of Trump@-@s outrageousness well before the New Year. </s> <s> Once the novelty faded, so went the theory, the G. O. P. electorate would turn its attention @-@ as it almost always had in the past @-@ to the candidates with strong records of political achievement. </s> <s> Most of these, like Kasich, were governors. </s> <s> Kasich@-@s line, then as now, was that in the end, the public would opt for @-@someone who can land the plane. </s> <s> @-@ That a mad bomber might be the preferred alternative seemed a ludicrous notion. </s> <s> Today a Trump victory seems less far-fetched. </s> <s> It is Kasich, currently polling sixth in New Hampshire @-@and 21 points behind Trump@-@, who faces long odds of winning there on Feb. 9. </s> <s> Other sitting or former governors have fared little better. </s> <s> The Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal and the Wisconsin governor Scott Walker have dropped out of the race entirely, as has the former Texas governor Rick Perry. </s> <s> The sole exception at the moment seems to be the New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who is campaigning less as a state executive and more as the pugilistic former federal prosecutor he once was @-@ with the result that he has climbed to fourth in New Hampshire @-@though still ranks near the bottom of the pack in national polls@-@. </s> <s> Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, is polling just ahead of Kasich in fifth place. </s> <s> For Republican primary voters, at least, pilots are mostly out, bombers are in. </s> <s> Kasich is the purest example of this inversion: What had in previous elections been a badge of honor @-@ not just his executive experience as a governor but his experience in government period @-@ now marks him as a confederate of a corrupt political system that, in the Trumpian view of things, has crippled America. </s> <s> Conversely, the candidates who are currently showing life @-@ Christie as well as two first-term United States senators, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz @-@ have implicitly renounced the low trade of governing, focusing less on what they have done than on what they have prevented from being done. </s> <s> In this way, @-@good governance@-@ has become not just an oxymoron but a politically poisonous phrase from a dead language. </s> <s> To utter it is to mark your political extinction @-@ or so the thinking goes in the winning camps these days. </s> <s> Kasich is, in a way, the last holdout, espousing old-fashioned sentiments about America@-@s yearning to @-@hang together@-@ and his desire to lead with @-@a big heart@-@ rather than with a fusillade of invective. </s> <s> His approach may ultimately be proved right, but only if virtually every poll is wrong. </s> <s> When campaign strategists describe their clients@-@ @-@path to victory,@-@ they employ data-@-@spangled language intended to convey inevitable geometric logic, often unaware that the journey they@-@re describing is almost Tolkienesque in the leaps of the imagination required to think it possible. </s> <s> According to the parlance of the day, the Republican candidates occupy one of two @-@lanes. </s> <s> @-@ Trump, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina are competing in the @-@outsider lane. </s> <s> @-@ Their raison d@-@tre is a scornfulness toward Washington. </s> <s> Each boasts a proud record of nonachievement in the field of governance; their r@-@sum@-@s are instead litanies of private-@-@sector accolades or colorfully expressed grievances against the Beltway political class. </s> <s> The members of that Beltway political class, meanwhile, hold that the dominant outsider will ultimately be pitted against the leading occupant of the @-@establishment lane,@-@ who would eventually prevail once voters faced up to the desirability of a candidate who can, returning to Kasich@-@s preferred metaphor, @-@land the plane@-@ @-@ though of late pundits have taken note of Cruz@-@s surge in Iowa and allowed for the possibility of a third lane @-@base purist? </s> <s> anti-establishment ideologue? </s> <s> @-@ that he alone occupies. </s> <s> For the first half of 2015, Jeb Bush was thought to have owned the establishment lane. </s> <s> After a few notable stumbles on his part, mainstream party leaders anxiously began pondering alternatives. </s> <s> Christie seemed fatally tainted by the scandal involving political appointees of his who ordered lane closures on the George Washington Bridge. </s> <s> Perry was equally hamstrung by his embarrassing performance on a debate stage in the previous campaign, during which his memory went dark while trying to recall which three federal agencies he planned to eliminate. </s> <s> Jindal could not overcome a yawning charisma deficit. </s> <s> Walker, meanwhile, had achieved distinction as a conservative gladiator in a blue state, but his ignorance of foreign affairs became increasingly difficult to overlook. </s> <s> At least those seemed to be the problems. </s> <s> Why else would they be struggling?It was in this jittery climate that Kasich entered the race in July. </s> <s> A few assumptions, all perfectly reasonable at the time, underlay his path to victory. </s> <s> Kasich wasn@-@t the progeny of a political dynasty like Bush but instead the son of a letter carrier from McKees Rocks, Pa. His reputation, as a nine-term Ohio congressman, had been that of a scrappy and at times obnoxious fiscal conservative. </s> <s> Kasich was deeply religious, unfailingly anti-abortion and unburdened by personal scandal. </s> <s> An independent thinker, Kasich was sometimes at odds with members of his own party, particularly in 2013, when he committed the apostasy of accepting the expansion of Medicaid in Ohio under the terms of the Affordable Care Act. </s> <s> Nonetheless, he did not fit the bill of a @-@Republican who hates Republicans@-@ in the manner of the former Utah governor and 2012 presidential candidate Jon Huntsman. </s> <s> He was notably popular across the political spectrum in Ohio, a state that has historically proved crucial to any G. O. P. presidential victory. </s> <s> These qualities, combined with his working-class pedigree and deficit-hawk credentials, would propel Kasich to victory in New Hampshire, a state with a longstanding affection for unvarnished Everymen. </s> <s> In this manner he would wrest the establishment lane from the dynastic Bush and the inexperienced Rubio. </s> <s> So went the theory of Kasich@-@s case. </s> <s> But that case rested on an arguably false premise. </s> <s> Perhaps there was no establishment lane. </s> <s> The Kasich campaign@-@s obsession with beating Bush presupposed that Republican voters had the slightest interest in candidates who preached from the gospel of governance. </s> <s> Every poll reflected that the opposite was true. </s> <s> People were responding to the outsiders @-@ and correspondingly turning away from those candidates, like Kasich and Bush, who ran on the idea that they @-@can fix it,@-@ in the words of Bush@-@s widely mocked campaign slogan. </s> <s> Senators Rubio and Cruz recognized this; their stump speeches reflected more of what they had fought against @-@ Obamacare, gun control, climate-@-@change accords @-@ than what they had actually accomplished with their Senate colleagues. </s> <s> In this manner, they experienced gains in the polls as had the genuine outsiders in the race: Trump, Carson and Fiorina. </s> <s> That Republican voters would suddenly tune out champions of old-fashioned governance like Kasich and Bush should not have been such a startling development. </s> <s> That trend began to emerge with the advent of the Tea Party in 2009. </s> <s> By the time Bush announced the formation of his exploratory committee at the end of 2014, a number of Republican assumptions were already upended. </s> <s> One was that conservatives would digest the lessons of the 2012 presidential election, tune out the Tea Party@-@s more extremist demands @-@like repealing Obamacare and deporting all illegal immigrants@-@, heed the electoral realities and lurch gamely toward the center. </s> <s> Another was that the party@-@s well-being was best served by offering the nomination to an old hand at Washington-style governance who had waited his turn @-@ like Bob Dole in 1996, John McCain in 2008, Mitt Romney in 2012 and, perhaps, another Bush in 2016. </s> <s> By 2013, yet another widely accepted truth @-@ that even conservative voters expected their elected representatives to govern like adults and would therefore punish legislative tantrums @-@ was also stood on its head. </s> <s> That was the year a rump faction of House Republicans, urged on by Senator Cruz, forced a government shutdown in an effort to defund Obamacare. </s> <s> Establishment Republicans warned that this move stood no chance of success and would plunge the party@-@s already-dismal approval ratings to record depths. </s> <s> They were right on the first point but wrong on the second. </s> <s> A year after the shutdown in 2014, the Republicans picked up additional seats in the House and regained the Senate majority. </s> <s> Whether anyone noticed it at the time, the electoral outcome of the 2013 shutdown would have direct implications for the 2016 Republican presidential field. </s> <s> As Republican anger over Obama@-@s perceived inability to lead both at home and abroad gave rise to the summer, fall and winter of Trump, it became harder for the candidates in the establishment lane to extol the virtues of sensible governance. </s> <s> Any sentence that began with phrases like @-@I worked with the legislature to pass@-@ or @-@We need to come together@-@ was interpreted by voters as @-@I@-@m part of everything you distrust. </s> <s> @-@ This dawning reality would fall hardest on the governors in the race. </s> <s> Even the jut-jawed conservative records of Perry and Walker bore the aroma of executive discernment and, here and there, compromise. </s> <s> Besides, as Trump@-@s ideological waywardness would attest, Republican voters did not seem to be fixated on whose portfolio was the most conservative. </s> <s> They wanted to know who was spoiling for a fight. </s> <s> Only Kasich continued to maintain that what Americans really wanted was not a pugilist but rather the calming figure that he strove to be as the self-described @-@father of Ohio. </s> <s> @-@ Kasich@-@s determination to remain the candidate of sensible, solutions-based governance would set up an arresting contrast between the way our politics once were and how they now are. </s> <s> Throughout the fall, while Trump was hawking copies of his latest book, @-@Crippled America,@-@ and telling audiences that their country had lost its greatness, Kasich was urging people to @-@thank God that we live in America. </s> <s> @-@ The line seldom got applause, and by December, Kasich had discarded it. </s> <s> But his crusty optimism seemed, like his striped golf shirts and affinity for cheesy rock bands, to belong to another era. </s> <s> Voters felt cheated by government and angry toward those, like Kasich, who openly defended it. </s> <s> Nowhere has this seemed more apparent than in the debates, which, thus far, have been the best forum through which candidates have been able to improve their overall public standing. </s> <s> Trump, Fiorina, Cruz, Rubio and Christie have all achieved noticeable upsurges in the polls through their debate performances. </s> <s> Kasich, who remains one of the least-known Republican contestants outside of the state he governs, repeatedly failed to make the most of the time allotted him. </s> <s> In rehearsals before the early rounds, Kasich@-@s strategists prepped him to remain above the fray, accentuate his accomplishments and leave the trash-talking to others. </s> <s> A result was that he seemed to vaporize onstage. </s> <s> Kasich overcompensated in the fourth debate with a blustery, interrupting performance that was universally panned. </s> <s> When he directly confronted Trump for his pledge to round up and deport the country@-@s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants @-@ calling it @-@a silly argument,@-@ not to mention a meanspirited policy in which @-@children would be terrified@-@ @-@ the front-runner@-@s reaction provided a stark illustration of which candidate had a more intuitive grasp of the Republican electorate@-@s impatience with plodding, humane governance. </s> <s> Citing President Eisenhower, who deported roughly a million undocumented Mexican immigrants, Trump said America@-@s niceness should not stand in the way of America@-@s greatness. </s> <s> @-@We have no choice,@-@ he said. </s> <s> As for Kasich, he simply dismissed him: @-@I built an unbelievable company worth billions and billions of dollars. </s> <s> I don@-@t have to hear from this man, believe me. </s> <s> @-@When I spent several days with Kasich in September, he was drawing sizable crowds in New Hampshire and clearly relishing his position as a largely unknown but emerging candidate who seemed well positioned for a breakthrough moment. </s> <s> For a man who has spent nearly all of his adult life in politics, Kasich comes off as scruffily

@-@It@-@s not the individual pixels, but the mosaic,@-@ Mr. Spiezle said. </s> <s> The digitization of many of these voter files in recent years has opened the door for more data breaches. </s> <s> Just in the past year, there have been some major disclosures of information. </s> <s> More than six million voters in Georgia had their voting information and Social Security numbers exposed in a breach back in October. </s> <s> And in Florida, personal voter information about an undisclosed number of @-@high-risk professionals@-@ such as judges and law enforcement officials was mistakenly

In 2008, Barack Obama@-@s campaign and Senator John McCain@-@s campaign were reported to have been hacked by the Chinese government. </s> <s> In 2012, the Obama and Mitt Romney campaigns were subjected to repeated hacking attempts, sometimes as often as four to five times a week. </s> <s> Because of this threat, some campaigns have been taking steps to make sure their data and

data may have been of real use only to the Sanders campaign; had it fallen into the hands of a hacker or activist group, it would have essentially the same worth as the publicly available data. </s>

in January to round up and deport hundreds of undocumented families, hoping to discourage a renewed surge in illegal border crossings but risking a firestorm in an election year when immigration is again a dominant topic. </s> <s> The raids in communities across the country will begin almost two years after nearly 100,000 families and tens of thousands of unaccompanied children started illegally crossing the southern border with Mexico, mostly from Central America. </s> <s> That surge overwhelmed detention facilities, sending most families into American cities with little more than a court summons. </s> <s> Many failed to appear in court on the appointed days and were ordered deported. </s> <s> Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will fan out across the country to enforce hundreds of those orders, according to immigration officials who refused to be identified because they were not allowed to openly discuss an enforcement program that has yet to begin. </s> <s> When they find the families, agents will detain and immediately deport them, officials said. </s> <s> Plans for the raids were first reported by The Washington Post. </s> <s> @-@Our border is not open to illegal immigration, and if individuals come here illegally, do not qualify for asylum or other relief, and have final orders of removal, they will be sent back consistent with our laws and our

Christensen, press secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also known as ICE. </s> <s> The raids come at a sensitive time for President Obama and the Democratic front-runner to succeed him, Hillary Clinton. </s> <s> A record pace for deportations in 2014 earned Mr. Obama the disparaging nickname @-@deporter in chief@-@ among pro-immigrant activists whose criticism helped inspire executive orders to pull back on deportations and offer temporary legal status to hundreds of thousands of undocumented workers. </s> <s> But those orders have so far been blocked in court, as Republican presidential candidates gain traction on pledges to get tough on such immigrants. </s> <s> Mrs. Clinton has largely sided with the pro-immigration community, but the new sweeps could test her. </s> <s> @-@To even contemplate this kind of aggressive roundup is to double down on a failed policy,@-@ said Gregory Chen, director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. </s> <s> @-@These are Central American families who are seeking asylum and should be given humanitarian protection rather than being treated as illegal border crossers. </s> <s> @-@The raids are intended to stem a renewed surge in families and children crossing the border. </s> <s> Alarm bells sounded in November after a sharp rise in the number of youths with and without parents who were being apprehended by the border authorities, mainly in South Texas. </s> <s> A total of 5,622 unaccompanied youths were stopped at the border with Mexico, more than double the number seen in November 2014. </s> <s> The surge is particularly worrisome since illegal crossings typically decline during the fall and winter. </s> <s> Families and young people are coming mostly from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. </s> <s> Underlying factors include a surge in gang-related violence in El Salvador and Honduras, a deteriorating economy in Guatemala and a regionwide drought driving the exodus. </s> <s> The planned effort was immediately denounced by both pro-immigration groups that called it heartless, and anti-immigration advocates who dismissed it as window dressing. </s> <s> It comes in the midst of a political season in which illegal immigration and refugee resettlement have been vilified. </s> <s> Donald J. Trump, a leading Republican presidential contender, has called Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers, and 25 Republican governors have vowed to block resettlement of Syrian refugees in their states. </s> <s> The Obama administration has sought to preserve its refugee resettlement program, which settles some 80,000 people from around the world each year. </s> <s> The administration said that it intends to include about 10,000 refugees from Syria by next September. </s> <s> After terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., and Paris, the administration is trying to reassure the nation that the borders are under control, and that it is effectively vetting foreigners coming into the country. </s> <s> But its efforts have been denounced across the political spectrum. </s> <s> Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said that the roundup campaign was a political smokescreen. </s> <s> @-@If they@-@re only targeting a few hundred people, then this is window dressing designed to fool people into thinking they have things under control,@-@ he said. </s> <s> @-@But people know that if you show up at the border with kids, then you@-@re in. </s> <s> @-@Among Mr. Obama@-@s allies, the response was different, though. </s> <s> @-@These are children who have seen some of the worst conditions in the world, at high risk of being trafficked and killed,@-@ said Carlos Vargas, co-director of Dream Action Coalition, which has strongly supported the president@-@s efforts to legalize the undocumented. </s> <s> @-@When Jesus, an immigrant, said, @-@Suffer the children to come unto me,@-@ he didn@-@t say, @-@Except the Latino kids @-@ let the gangs eat them. </s> <s> @-@Over all, illegal immigration across the Mexican border has fallen precipitously. </s> <s> The number of children and families crossing illegally, however, has spiked. </s> <s> Emma RollerBy Emma RollerDONALD J.

BrooksBACK in 1993, the misanthropic art critic Robert Hughes published a grumpy, entertaining book called @-@Culture of Complaint,@-@ in which he predicted that America was doomed to become increasingly an @-@infantilized culture@-@ of victimhood. </s> <s> It was a rant against what he saw as a grievance industry appearing all across the political spectrum. </s> <s> I enjoyed the book, but as a lifelong optimist about America, was unpersuaded by Mr. Hughes@-@s argument. </s> <s> I dismissed it as just another apocalyptic prediction about our culture. </s> <s> Unfortunately, the intervening two decades have made Mr. Hughes look prophetic and me look na@-@ve. </s> <s> @-@Victimhood culture@-@ has now been identified as a widening phenomenon by mainstream sociologists. </s> <s> And it is impossible to miss the obvious examples all around us. </s> <s> We can laugh off some of them, for example, the argument that the design of a Starbucks cup is evidence of a secularist war on Christmas. </s> <s> Others, however, are more ominous. </s> <s> On campuses, activists interpret ordinary interactions as @-@microaggressions@-@ and set up @-@safe spaces@-@ to protect students from certain forms of speech. </s> <s> And presidential candidates on both the left and the right routinely motivate supporters by declaring that they are under attack by immigrants or wealthy people. </s> <s> So who cares if we are becoming a culture of victimhood? </s> <s> We all should. </s> <s> To begin with, victimhood makes it more and more difficult for us to resolve political and social conflicts. </s> <s> The culture feeds a mentality that crowds out a necessary give and take @-@ the very concept of good-faith disagreement @-@ turning every policy difference into a pitched battle between good @-@us@-@ and evil @-@them@-@. </s> <s> Consider a 2014 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which examined why opposing groups, including Democrats and Republicans, found compromise so difficult. </s> <s> The researchers concluded that there was a widespread political @-@motive attribution asymmetry,@-@ in which both sides attributed their own group@-@s aggressive behavior to love, but the opposite side@-@s to hatred. </s> <s> Today, millions of Americans believe that their side is basically benevolent while the other side is evil and out to get them. </s> <s> Second, victimhood culture makes for worse citizens @-@ people who are less helpful, more entitled, and more selfish. </s> <s> In 2010, four social psychologists from Stanford University published an article titled @-@Victim Entitlement to Behave Selfishly@-@ in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. </s> <s> The researchers randomly assigned 104 human subjects to two groups. </s> <s> Members of one group were prompted to write a short essay about a time when they felt bored; the other to write about @-@a time when your life seemed unfair. </s> <s> Perhaps you felt wronged or slighted by someone. </s> <s> @-@ After writing the essay, the participants were interviewed and asked if they wanted to help the scholars in a simple, easy task. </s> <s> The results were stark. </s> <s> Those who wrote the essays about being wronged were 26 percent less likely to help the researchers, and were rated by the researchers as feeling 13 percent more entitled. </s> <s> In a separate experiment, the researchers found that members of the unfairness group were 11 percent more likely to express selfish attitudes. </s> <s> In a comical and telling aside, the researchers noted that the victims were more likely than the nonvictims to leave trash behind on the desks and to steal the experimenters@-@ pens. </s> <s> Does this mean that we should reject all claims that people are victims? </s> <s> Of course not. </s> <s> Some people are indeed victims in America @-@ of crime, discrimination or deprivation. </s> <s> They deserve our empathy and require justice. </s> <s> The problem is that the line is fuzzy between fighting for victimized people and promoting a victimhood culture. </s> <s> Where does the former stop and the latter start? </s> <s> I offer two signposts for your consideration. </s> <s> First, look at the role of free speech in the debate. </s> <s> Victims and their advocates always rely on free speech and open dialogue to articulate unpopular truths. </s> <s> They rely on free speech to assert their right to speak. </s> <s> Victimhood culture, by contrast, generally seeks to restrict expression in order to protect the sensibilities of its advocates. </s> <s> Victimhood claims the right to say who is and is not allowed to speak. </s> <s> What about speech that endangers others? </s> <s> Fair-minded people can discriminate between expression that puts people at risk and that which merely rubs some the wrong way. </s> <s> Speaking up for the powerless is often @-@offensive@-@ to conventional ears. </s> <s> Second, look at a movement@-@s leadership. </s> <s> The fight for victims is led by aspirational leaders who challenge us to cultivate higher values. </s> <s> They insist that everyone is capable of @-@ and has a right to @-@ earned success. </s> <s> They articulate visions of human dignity. </s> <s> But the organizations and people who ascend in a victimhood culture are very different. </s> <s> Some set themselves up as saviors; others focus on a common enemy. </s> <s> In all cases, they treat people less as individuals and more as aggrieved masses. </s> <s> Robert Hughes turned out to be pretty accurate in his vision, I@-@m afraid. </s> <s> It is still in our hands to prove him wrong, however, and cultivate a nation of strong individuals motivated by hope and opportunity, not one dominated by victimhood. </s> <s> But we have a long way to go. </s> <s> Until then, I suggest keeping a close eye on your pen. </s> <s> By Andrew E.

Biden Jr. @-@That@-@s why these egregious loopholes exist, and why it@-@s so hard to close them. </s> <s> @-@Each of the top 400 earners took home, on average, about @-@336 million in 2012, the latest year for which data is available. </s> <s> If the bulk of that money had been paid out as salary or wages, as it is for the typical American, the tax obligations of those wealthy taxpayers could have more than doubled. </s> <s> Instead, much of their income came from convoluted partnerships and high-end investment funds. </s> <s> Other earnings accrued in opaque family trusts and foreign shell corporations, beyond the reach of the tax authorities. </s> <s> The well-paid technicians who devise these arrangements toil away at white-shoe law firms and elite investment banks, as well as a variety of obscure boutiques. </s> <s> But at the fulcrum of the strategizing over how to minimize taxes are so-called family offices, the customized wealth management departments of Americans with hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in assets. </s> <s> Family offices have existed since the late 19th century, when the Rockefellers pioneered the institution, and gained popularity in the 1980s. </s> <s> But they have proliferated rapidly over the last decade, as the ranks of the super-rich, and the size of their fortunes, swelled to record proportions. </s> <s> @-@We have so much wealth being created, significant wealth, that it creates a need for the family office structure now,@-@ said Sree Arimilli, an industry recruiting consultant. </s> <s> Family offices, many of which are dedicated to managing and protecting the wealth of a single family, oversee everything from investment strategy to philanthropy. </s> <s> But tax planning is a core function. </s> <s> While the specific techniques these advisers employ to minimize taxes can be mind-numbingly complex, they generally follow a few simple principles, like converting one type of income into another type that@-@s taxed at a lower rate. </s> <s> Mr. Loeb, for example, has invested in a Bermuda-based reinsurer @-@ an insurer to insurance companies @-@ that turns around and invests the money in his hedge fund. </s> <s> That maneuver transforms his profits from short-term bets in the market, which the government taxes at roughly 40 percent, into long-term profits, known as capital gains, which are taxed at roughly half that rate. </s> <s> It has had the added advantage of letting Mr. Loeb defer taxes on this income indefinitely, allowing his wealth to compound and grow more quickly. </s> <s> The Bermuda insurer Mr. Loeb helped set up went public in 2013 and is active in the insurance business, not merely a tax dodge. </s> <s> Mr. Cohen and Mr. Bacon abandoned similar insurance-based strategies in recent years. </s> <s> @-@Our investment in Max Re was not a tax-driven scheme, but rather a sound investment response to investor interest in a more dynamically managed portfolio akin to Warren Buffett@-@s Berkshire Hathaway,@-@ said Mr. Bacon, who leads Moore Capital Management. </s> <s> @-@Hedge funds were a minority of the investment portfolio, and Moore Capital@-@s products a much smaller subset of this alternative portfolio. </s> <s> @-@ Mr. Loeb and Mr. Cohen declined to comment. </s> <s> Organizing one@-@s business as a partnership can be lucrative in its own right. </s> <s> Some of the partnerships from which the wealthy derive their income are allowed to sell shares to the public, making it easy to cash out a chunk of the business while retaining control. </s> <s> But unlike publicly traded corporations, they pay no corporate income tax; the partners pay taxes as individuals. </s> <s> And the income taxes are often reduced by large deductions, such as for depreciation. </s> <s> For large private partnerships, meanwhile, the I. R. S. often struggles @-@to determine whether a tax shelter exists, an abusive tax transaction is being used,@-@ according to a recent report by the Government Accountability Office. </s> <s> The agency is not allowed to collect underpaid taxes directly from these partnerships, even those with several hundred partners. </s> <s> Instead, it must collect from each individual partner, requiring the agency to commit significant time and manpower. </s> <s> The wealthy can also avail themselves of a range of esoteric and customized tax deductions that go far beyond writing off a home office or dinner with a client. </s> <s> One aggressive strategy is to place income in a type of charitable trust, generating a deduction that offsets the income tax. </s> <s> The trust then purchases what@-@s known as a private placement life insurance policy, which invests the money on a tax-free basis, frequently in a number of hedge funds. </s> <s> The person@-@s heirs can inherit, also tax-free, whatever money is left after the trust pays out a percentage each year to charity, often a considerable sum. </s> <s> Many of these maneuvers are well established, and wealthy taxpayers say they are well within their rights to exploit them. </s> <s> Others exist in a legal gray area, its boundaries defined by the willingness of taxpayers to defend their strategies against the I. R. S. Almost all are outside the price range of the average taxpayer. </s> <s> Among tax lawyers and accountants, @-@the best and brightest get a high from figuring out how to do tricky little deals,@-@ said Karen L. Hawkins, who until recently headed the I. R. S. office that oversees tax practitioners. </s> <s> @-@Frankly, it is almost beyond the intellectual and resource capacity of the Internal Revenue Service to catch. </s> <s> @-@The combination of cost and complexity has had a profound effect, tax experts said. </s> <s> Whatever tax rates Congress sets, the actual rates paid by the ultra-wealthy tend to fall over time as they exploit their numerous advantages. </s> <s> From Mr. Obama@-@s inauguration through the end of 2012, federal income tax rates on individuals did not change @-@excluding payroll taxes@-@. </s> <s> But the highest-earning one-thousandth of Americans went from paying an average of 20.9 percent to 17.6 percent. </s> <s> By contrast, the top 1 percent, excluding the very wealthy, went from paying just under 24 percent on average to just over that level. </s> <s> @-@We do have two different tax systems, one for normal wage-earners and another for those who can afford sophisticated tax advice,@-@ said Victor Fleischer, a law professor at the University of San Diego who studies the intersection of tax policy and inequality. </s> <s> @-@At the very top of the income distribution, the effective rate of tax goes down, contrary to the principles of a progressive income tax system. </s> <s> @-@Having helped foster an alternative tax system, wealthy Americans have been aggressive in defending it. </s> <s> Trade groups representing the Bermuda-based insurance company Mr. Loeb helped set up, for example, have spent the last several months pleading with the I. R. S. that its proposed rules tightening the hedge fund insurance loophole are too onerous. </s> <s> The major industry group representing private equity funds spends hundreds of thousands of dollars each year lobbying on such issues as @-@carried interest,@-@ the granddaddy of Wall Street tax loopholes, which makes it possible for fund managers to pay the capital gains rate rather than the higher standard tax rate on a substantial share of their income for running the fund. </s> <s> The budget deal that Congress approved in October allows the I. R. S. to collect underpaid taxes from large partnerships at the firm level for the first time @-@ which is far easier for the agency @-@ thanks to a provision that lawmakers slipped into the deal at the last minute, before many lobbyists could mobilize. </s> <s> But the new rules are relatively weak @-@ firms can still choose to have partners pay the taxes @-@ and don@-@t take effect until 2018, giving the wealthy plenty of time to weaken them further. </s> <s> Shortly after the provision passed, the Managed Funds Association, an industry group that represents prominent hedge funds like D. E. Shaw, Renaissance Technologies, Tiger Management and Third Point, began meeting with members of Congress to discuss a wish list of adjustments. </s> <s> The founders of these funds have all donated at least @-@500,000 to 2016 presidential candidates. </s> <s> During the Obama presidency, the association itself has risen to become one of the most powerful trade groups in Washington, spending over @-@4 million a year on lobbying. </s> <s> And while the lobbying clout of the wealthy is most often deployed through industry trade associations and lawyers, some rich families have locked arms to advance their interests more directly. </s> <s> The inheritance tax has been a primary target. </s> <s> In the early 1990s, a California family office executive named Patricia Soldano began lobbying on behalf of wealthy families to repeal the tax, which would not only save them money, but also make it easier to preserve their business empires from one generation to the next. </s> <s> The idea struck many hardened operatives as unrealistic at the time, given that the tax affected only the wealthiest Americans. </s> <s> But Ms. Soldano@-@s efforts @-@ funded in part by the Mars and Koch families @-@ laid the groundwork for a one-year elimination in 2010. </s> <s> The tax has been restored, but currently applies only to couples leaving roughly @-@11 million or more to their heirs, up from those leaving more than @-@1.2 million when Ms. Soldano started her campaign. </s> <s> It affected fewer than 5,200 families last year. </s> <s> @-@If anyone would have told me we@-@d be where we are today, I would never have guessed it,@-@ Ms. Soldano said in an interview. </s> <s> Some of the most profound victories are barely known outside the insular world of the wealthy and their financial managers. </s> <s> In 2009, Congress set out to require that investment partnerships like hedge funds register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, partly so that regulators would have a better grasp on the risks they posed to the financial system. </s> <s> The early legislative language would have required single-family offices to register as well, exposing the highly secretive institutions to scrutiny that their clients were eager to avoid. </s> <s> Some of the I. R. S.@-@s cases against the wealthy originate with tips from the S. E. C., which is often better positioned to spot tax evasion. </s> <s> By the summer of 2009, several family office executives had formed a lobbying group called the Private Investor Coalition to push back against the proposal. </s> <s> The coalition won an exemption in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, then spent much of the next year persuading the S. E. C. to largely adopt its preferred definition of @-@family office. </s> <s> @-@So expansive was the resulting loophole that Mr. Soros@-@s @-@24.5 billion hedge fund took advantage of it, converting to a family office after returning capital to its remaining outside investors. </s> <s> The hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller, a former business partner of Mr. Soros, took the same step. </s> <s> The Soros family, which generally supports Democrats, has committed at least @-@1 million to the 2016 presidential campaign; Mr. Druckenmiller, who favors Republicans, has put slightly more than @-@300,000 behind three different G.

E. C. staff. </s> <s> @-@All with a low profile,@-@ the document noted. </s> <s> @-@We got most of what we wanted AND a few extras we didn@-@t request. </s> <s> @-@After all the loopholes and all the lobbying, what remains of the government@-@s ability to collect taxes from the wealthy runs up against one final hurdle: the crisis facing the I. R. S. President Obama has made fighting tax evasion by the rich a priority. </s> <s> In 2010, he signed legislation making it easier to identify Americans who squirreled away assets in Swiss bank accounts and Cayman Islands shelters. </s> <s> His I. R. S. convened a Global High Wealth Industry Group, known colloquially as @-@the wealth squad,@-@ to scrutinize the returns of Americans with incomes of at least @-@10 million a year. </s> <s> But while these measures have helped the government retrieve billions, the agency@-@s efforts have flagged in the face of scandal, political pressure and budget cuts. </s> <s> Between 2010, the year before Republicans took control of the House of Representatives, and 2014, the I. R. S. budget dropped by almost @-@2 billion in real terms, or nearly 15 percent. </s> <s> That has forced it to shed about 5,000 high-level enforcement positions out of about 23,000, according to the agency. </s> <s> Audit rates for the @-@10 million-plus club spiked in the first few years of the Global High Wealth program, but have plummeted since then. </s> <s> The political challenge for the agency became especially acute in 2013, after the agency acknowledged singling out conservative nonprofits in a review of political activity by tax-exempt groups. </s> <s> @-@Senior officials left the agency as a result of the controversy. </s> <s> @-@Several former I.

RamseyTHE Democrats need young black voters. </s> <s> But the political party of our parents doesn@-@t seem to know how to reach us @-@ the black millennials they can@-@t afford to lose @-@ this time around. </s> <s> Activists associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, which sprang up in the aftermath of protests over the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., have been challenging the Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton over the past few months through direct action and protests at their campaign events. </s> <s> So far, the candidates have responded reluctantly to the prodding, and in ways that show they underestimate the number of voters behind the movement. </s> <s> In 2008, roughly 11 percent of the electorate were first-time voters. </s> <s> Over 20 percent of these @-@surge voters@-@ were black, and 70 percent were under 30 years old. </s> <s> And in 2012, according to the Cook Political Report, black voters accounted for the president@-@s margin of victory in seven key states: Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. </s> <s> Black youth turnout increased a full eight percentage points between 2004 and 2008, with more than half of eligible young black voters casting ballots in the 2008 election. </s> <s> In contrast, white youth turnout was relatively flat for the same period. </s> <s> In addition, blacks 18 to 44 years old made up@-@ 48 percent of the black voters who turned out in 2012. </s> <s> The Democratic Party isn@-@t really at risk of losing these voters to the other party. </s> <s> But it can@-@t take them for granted. </s> <s> A Washington Post analysis found that if black support for Democrats drops from the highs of President Obama@-@s 93 and 95 percent showings back to the historical average of 85 percent, it could cost Democrats a net of 2.8 million votes. </s> <s> Instead of really engaging black millennials where we are, the leading Democratic presidential candidates are relying on stale outreach strategies. </s> <s> They@-@re visiting historic black churches, making public appearances with civil-rights-era black leaders and failing to engage in real substantive debate on potential policy solutions to issues of racial injustice. </s> <s> Recently, Mrs. Clinton marked the 60th anniversary of the Montgomery bus boycott with an appearance at the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church in Montgomery, Ala. </s> <s> In a November interview with NPR, Mr. Sanders, lamenting his weak support among blacks, again touted his record on civil rights legislation and his economic platform as a way of addressing racial inequality. </s> <s> And when the Clinton campaign rolled out its @-@African-Americans for Hillary@-@ group, it did so with an Atlanta luncheon for black ministers, including Jesse Jackson, followed by a rally. </s> <s> Students from @-@AUCShutItDown, a Black Lives Matter affiliate group operating throughout Atlanta@-@s historically black colleges, disrupted the rally with chants of @-@black lives matter. </s> <s> @-@ In a statement regarding the protest, the group wrote critically of Mrs. Clinton@-@s lack of direct action and engagement: @-@Unfortunately, rhetoric DOES NOT save us, nor does it give confidence to black voters that we can trust Hillary to prioritize the necessity of ensuring our safety. </s> <s> @-@Black millennials are unlike any other generation of black voters the Democratic Party has had to court. </s> <s> Born roughly two decades after the biggest wins of the civil rights movement, we@-@ve experienced both its benefits and failures. </s> <s> We grew up in neighborhoods and matriculated at schools that were resegregated. </s> <s> And while many of us participated in the election of the nation@-@s first black president, we@-@ve witnessed what feels like his inability to adequately serve black Americans in the face of continued economic challenges and systematic police brutality. </s> <s> As a result, we are not satisfied with the Democratic Party@-@s mere acknowledgment of our issues, nor are we charmed by their willingness to appear in black churches. </s> <s> Like all other constituents, we need to be targeted and convinced. </s> <s> So far, the candidates have spent far too little time debating the policies that shape racial justice. </s> <s> At the top of 2016 they have a chance, with a debate sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus in which they should focus less on movements of the past and more on the one in front of them. </s> <s> To be fair, the leading Democratic presidential campaigns seem to be learning from the Black Lives Matter movement. </s> <s> Between June and the first Democratic debate in October, Mrs. Clinton evolved from saying @-@all lives matter@-@ at a black church outside of Ferguson to meeting privately with Black Lives Matter groups and elevating criminal justice reform in her platform. </s> <s> Mr. Sanders has arguably shown the most growth. </s> <s> Since being confronted by Black Lives Matter protesters at the Netroots Nation conference in July, he has met privately with activists and published a racial justice agenda that addresses issues of economic, legal, political and physical violence against people of color. </s> <s> Still, these acknowledgments of the Black Lives Matter movement do not rise to such a level that they can be considered outreach to black millennials or a substantive engagement with our issues. </s> <s> Representative John Lewis, the civil rights icon who introduced Mrs. Clinton at her @-@African-Americans for Hillary@-@ event, spoke about the protests to reporters afterward. </s> <s> When asked about the seeming dissonance between his presence at the event and that of the millennial protesters, Mr. Lewis said, @-@I think they represent another time, another period. </s> <s> @-@Indeed, the period that black millennials represent is the current one. </s> <s> While many of us have reverence for the political gains made by those who came before us, we are not bound by their politics or approach to civic engagement. </s> <s> So, if the leading Democratic candidates want the support of this increasingly influential segment of the electorate, they@-@ll have to forgo their usual youth and black outreach tactics for ones that take seriously the intersection of those identities. </s> <s> Otherwise there@-@s a risk that black millennials will stay home in the first post-Obama presidential election. </s> <s> Frank BruniBy Frank BruniEverybody pees. </s> <s> That@-@s actually the name of a public service campaign by the National Kidney Foundation, and I thought it a needless statement of the obvious until Donald Trump brought me to my senses. </s> <s> Apparently some people think that the laws of urology don@-@t apply to them. </s> <s> Apparently Trump is in this category. </s> <s> On Monday he said this of Hillary Clinton@-@s mid-debate bathroom break: @-@I know where she went. </s> <s> It@-@s disgusting. </s> <s> I don@-@t want to talk about it. </s> <s> No, it@-@s too disgusting. </s> <s> @-@He didn@-@t specify why. </s> <s> But it@-@s difficult to find anything indecorous about Clinton@-@s behavior unless you see it as entirely volitional and utterly controllable @-@ something you do to indulge yourself, something that can be put off for hours or forever, an emblem of your weakness. </s> <s> I guess in Trump@-@s world, only @-@low energy@-@ people need to go. </s> <s> That would make sense, given how fantastical his cosmos is. </s> <s> It@-@s a place where thousands of Muslims in New Jersey publicly cheer the fall of the World Trade Center; where a stretch of the Potomac River alongside a Virginia golf club of his magically becomes a Civil War site; where his own net worth changes by an order of billions from one moment to the next, in accordance with his need to puff up his chest. </s> <s> Why wouldn@-@t it also be a place where people relieve themselves only if they@-@re losers and they@-@re intent on a messiness that they can avoid? </s> <s> Maybe Trump really doesn@-@t pee. </s> <s> Maybe he outsources that to a Mexican immigrant in his employ. </s> <s> You have to hand it to him: He divines character flaws where no one else could or would. </s> <s> Through his warped lens, there@-@s shame in John McCain@-@s imprisonment in Vietnam, horror in Clinton@-@s use of a toilet, dysfunction in each bead of Marco Rubio@-@s sweat. </s> <s> Those last two items underscore his bizarre obsession with, and objection to, body fluids. </s> <s> In early November, Daniel Lippman of Politico noted that Trump had @-@remarked on Rubio@-@s perspiration at least eight times in the last seven weeks. </s> <s> @-@ On two of those occasions, Trump suggested that sweating would put Rubio at a disadvantage in negotiations with Vladimir Putin, who would find him too soggy. </s> <s> The fluids of women in particular rattle Trump. </s> <s> When a lawyer who was questioning him during a 2011 deposition asked for a break so that she could leave the room and pump breast milk for her 3-month-old daughter, he was unhinged. </s> <s> @-@You@-@re disgusting,@-@ he berated her, according to a story in The Times earlier this year by Michael Barbaro and Steve Eder. </s> <s> Then he stormed out of the deposition. </s> <s> More famously, he reflected on Megyn Kelly@-@s interrogation of him at the first Republican presidential debate by saying that @-@you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever. </s> <s> @-@Clinton@-@s bathroom break @-@ or, more precisely, Trump@-@s revulsion toward it @-@ lies at the intersection of his misogyny and his fastidiousness. </s> <s> He@-@s a germophobe who once labeled himself @-@a clean hands freak,@-@ called handshakes a @-@terrible custom@-@ and said that the obligation to engage in them was one of the great curses of celebrity like his. </s> <s> Even so, a kidney doctor I know was baffled by his latest outburst. </s> <s> @-@Urine is sterile,@-@ Maya Rao, an assistant professor of nephrology at Columbia University, pointed out. </s> <s> @-@It@-@s not @-@disgusting. </s> <s> @-@ Wow. </s> <s> I literally feel like I@-@m dealing with an elementary-school child and we@-@re talking about cooties. </s> <s> @-@Trump is routinely @-@ and rightly @-@ tagged as a playground bully, but that phrase doesn@-@t do full justice to his arrested development, his potty mouth and the puerile nature of his vulgar bleats. </s> <s> He taunts people for being unpopular, for being unattractive, for physical disabilities. </s> <s> The altitude of his debate vocabulary is only millimeters above @-@I know you are but what am I,@-@ words that he@-@ll surely utter before this is all over. </s> <s> On Monday he not only cringed at Clinton@-@s bathroom visit, he mocked her loss in the 2008 presidential election by substituting a phallic verb for the word defeated. </s> <s> This, ladies and gentlemen, is your Republican front-runner. </s> <s> It@-@s probably too late to teach him manners, but maybe not to teach him biology: When you imbibe fluids, you excrete fluids, sometimes through sweat, often through urine. </s> <s> And while @-@the typical person goes to the bathroom

</s> <s> Could he really win without an early state, as the betting markets imply, and as his campaign seems to believe?Usually, it would be pretty hard to win the nomination without an early victory. </s> <s> But this year, there@-@s a good case for why it might be easier: The candidates favored in Iowa and New Hampshire might be such flawed candidates that they would not necessarily block Mr. Rubio. </s> <s> Those candidates, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, will face protracted resistance from the party@-@s elite and many of its voters. </s> <s> The opposition they face will not evaporate, even if one of them wins in Iowa and New Hampshire. </s> <s> Opposition could even grow in a desperate, last-ditch effort to stop them @-@ assuming such an effort still seems possible. </s> <s> How could Mr. Rubio win if Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump split Iowa and New Hampshire, or if one of them won both? </s> <s> Three conditions would need to be met. </s> <s> First, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump would need to have fundamentally limited appeal, so limited that it could not be overcome even by resounding success in Iowa and New Hampshire. </s> <s> Obviously, there is danger for Mr. Rubio here. </s> <s> Either candidate could roll to the nomination, the way John Kerry did in 2004 or John McCain did in 2008. </s> <s> But in general, pundits and analysts tend to overestimate the potential for early-state victories to catapult candidates to the nomination. </s> <s> Momentum helps candidates reach their potential, and in the case of candidates who possess the broad appeal and elite backing necessary to win the nomination, that can be enough. </s> <s> But early wins don@-@t let candidates overcome their limitations. </s> <s> It@-@s something we@-@ve seen over and over again in recent years. </s> <s> A win in Iowa helped Mike Huckabee win evangelicals for the rest of the race, but it didn@-@t help him win more secular voters. </s> <s> In 2012, Mitt Romney was a very close second in Iowa and won New Hampshire, and yet still couldn@-@t break through in South Carolina, where religious conservatives reign, as they do throughout the South. </s> <s> And then of course there was Barack Obama, who won a long string of primaries and caucuses in 2008 and then still ran into a wall of traditionally more moderate and conservative Democratic voters in the South and Appalachia, narrowly holding off Hillary Clinton. </s> <s> So Mr. Cruz could win Iowa, Mr. Trump could win New Hampshire, and there would still be plenty of room for a candidate who could appeal to the supporters who remain: the party@-@s mainstream conservative and moderate voters and elites. </s> <s> The second condition is that Mr. Rubio would need to fill the void and emerge as the natural candidate for those more mainstream conservative voters and donors. </s> <s> The easiest way to do it would be to beat those who are in the more moderate lane @-@ Chris Christie, Jeb Bush and John Kasich @-@ by a clear margin in New Hampshire, either outright forcing them out of the race or encouraging the party@-@s voters, donors and leaders to coalesce behind his candidacy. </s> <s> He could do this, even while losing the state to Mr. Trump, simply by outperforming the rest of the field by a wide enough margin. </s> <s> But Mr. Rubio has only a modest lead over Mr. Christie, Mr. Bush and Mr. Kasich in New Hampshire. </s> <s> Any of them could overtake him. </s> <s> All three candidates are paying more attention to the state than Mr. Rubio. </s> <s> And while Mr. Rubio may be a natural choice for mainstream conservatives, he is not such a great fit for moderate and independent voters @-@ the type who supported Mr. McCain in 2000 and 2008, and Ron Paul or Jon Huntsman in 2012. </s> <s> And those kinds of voters are overrepresented in the state. </s> <s> The third condition is that Mr. Rubio would need to hang on until more favorable states on March 8 and particularly March 15, because he probably won@-@t be doing much winning before then. </s> <s> The Republican primary calendar is front-loaded with relatively conservative and Southern states, which makes it very hard for a candidate in Mr. Rubio@-@s position to finesse an early win. </s> <s> There@-@s precedent for a candidate to wait it out until a more favorable stage of the calendar, and that candidate also happens to be someone who didn@-@t win Iowa or New Hampshire: Bill Clinton. </s> <s> He won just three of the first 14 contests before Super Tuesday in 1992, when the South voted for a favored son by a tremendous margin. </s> <s> To manage something similar, Mr. Rubio would need to do well in relatively favorable states like Nevada, Massachusetts, Colorado, Vermont and Virginia. </s> <s> He would need to do well enough to stay competitive in the hard delegate math, preventing either Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz from amassing a clear majority of delegates. </s> <s> From the standpoint of delegates, he would need to start winning on March 15. </s> <s> He would be counting on Florida, his winner-take-all home state, and either Ohio, another winner-take-all state, or Illinois, which has unusual delegate rules that make it pretty close to a winner-take-all state if a candidate wins by a modest margin. </s> <s> If he were to win Florida and either Illinois or Ohio @-@or both@-@, he would enter the second half of the primary season in a reasonable position. </s> <s> He wouldn@-@t be assured of victory @-@or even a majority of delegates@-@, but the mainstream of the Republican Party would probably see he was worth the investment. </s> <s> He could restock his war chest and go on to fight for the predominantly Democratic-leaning states that make up the final three months of the primary calendar. </s>
