# Project-1
This is a web crawler that uses the [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/) to create a corpus.
## Getting Started
This uses a Python wrapper for the New York Times API called [NYTimesArticleAPI](https://github.com/MattDMo/NYTimesArticleAPI).

Currently, the Pip install command is broken, so we have manually imported the package for you. Plans to fork the wrapper repo and host the updated package on PyPi are underway, stay tuned. 

Install NLTK package using pip or conda
```
pip install nltk
conda install nltk
```
## Steps to run
1. nytimes.py
2. cleanup.py
