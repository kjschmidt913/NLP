Lieberman of Connecticut, in a flurry of activity that included television appearances and a telephone news conference, said events in Iraq crystallized the differences between competing wings of the party and underlined the extent to which Dr. Dean would be a weak general election challenger. </s> <s> If Howard Dean had his way, Saddam Hussein would be in power today, not in prison, and the world would be a much more dangerous place, Mr. Lieberman said. </s> <s> The American people would have a lot more to fear. </s> <s> Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, who has been struggling to defend his support for the war in Iowa and New Hampshire, noted that in an earlier debate Dr. Dean had expressed ambivalence about the ouster of Mr. Hussein, as he and his aides sought to portray Dr. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, as suddenly exposed on the issue. </s> <s> I think that this is a time that underscores that if we@-@re going to beat George Bush, we need somebody who has the experience, and who got this policy right, Mr. Kerry added. </s> <s> Dr. Dean, taking a break from fund-raising in Florida on Sunday morning, offered rare words of praise for this White House in what aides described as a concerted effort to appear above the fray. </s> <s> This is a great day of pride in the American military, a great day for the Iraqis, a great day for the American people and, frankly, a great day for the administration, Dr. Dean said. </s> <s> He refused to speculate on what it might mean for the presidential campaign or his own candidacy. </s> <s> This is a day to celebrate the fact that Saddam@-@s been caught. </s> <s> We@-@ll have to wait to see what happens to the campaign later. </s> <s> And at a fund-raiser on Sunday evening in San Francisco, a center of of the antiwar movement, Dr. Dean assured the crowd of 1,800 people that he was not bowed by the news from abroad. </s> <s> He is a bad person and we are all better off with him in captivity, but you should know that my views on Iraq have not changed one bit, he said to a standing ovation. </s> <s> Some people said, @-@Oh, Saddam Hussein, he@-@s caught, now the whole campaign@-@s going to go away. </s> <s> @-@ I don@-@t think so. </s> <s> By any measure, the capture of Mr. Hussein shifted the presidential field yet again. </s> <s> Strategists for some of the Democratic campaigns said they had factored it into their electoral calculations, and they expressed hope that the memory of the dramatic event portrayed on television on Sunday would fade by next November. </s> <s> But with the first votes in the Democratic nominating contest fewer than 40 days away, it clearly heartened Democrats who supported the war. </s> <s> Mr. Lieberman proclaimed himself energized by the capture of Mr. Hussein, and he went so far as to call for the execution of the former Iraqi leader after a trial. </s> <s> Aides to Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, both of whom supported the war, said they hoped that Mr. Hussein@-@s capture would take some of the steam out of Dr. Dean@-@s engine. </s> <s> Mr. Gephardt declined to speculate on Sunday about the impact on his own campaign. </s> <s> I@-@ve said many times that I@-@ve done what I@-@ve done on Iraq because I thought it was the right thing to do regardless of the politics, Mr. Gephardt said by telephone from South Carolina, where he was campaigning. </s> <s> This is an issue of life and death, and you can@-@t play politics with it. </s> <s> Even though it had been anticipated to some extent, the early morning news from Iraq seemed to shock the candidates and their aides, and left several expressing grudging admiration at what one described as Mr. Bush@-@s continued good luck. </s> <s> They spent the day trying to applaud the capture while trying not to abandon their criticism of Mr. Bush@-@s management of the war in Iraq as well as their attacks upon one another. </s> <s> The strains this created were evident on Sunday. </s> <s> Mr. Kerry@-@s press secretary, Stephanie Cutter, sent an e-mail message to news organizations listing remarks Dr. Dean had made over the past six months that she said demonstrated that his opposition to the war was politically driven. </s> <s> But Ms. Cutter, reflecting the concern among the campaigns that they not be viewed as turning a foreign policy victory to political advantage, put a note on the top of the statement demanding that it be reported as background and attributed only to a Democratic campaign. </s> <s> General Wesley K.

S. has a unique role to play in this struggle to complete democracy@-@s triumph over tyranny and so drain the swamp of terror. </s> <s> Judging by his speech yesterday, Dean does not believe the U. S. has an exceptional role to play in world history. </s> <s> Dean did not argue that the U. S. should aggressively promote democracy in the Middle East and around the world. </s> <s> Instead, he emphasized that the U. S. should strive to strengthen global institutions. </s> <s> He argued that the war on terror would be won when international alliances worked together to choke off funds for terrorists and enforce a global arms control regime to keep nuclear, chemical and biological materials away from terror groups. </s> <s> Dean is not a modern-day Woodrow Wilson. </s> <s> He is not a mushy idealist who dreams of a world government. </s> <s> Instead, he spoke of international institutions as if they were big versions of the National Governors Association, as places where pragmatic leaders can go to leverage their own resources and solve problems. </s> <s> The world Dean described is largely devoid of grand conflicts or moral, cultural and ideological divides. </s> <s> It is a world without passionate nationalism, a world in which Europe and the United States are not riven by any serious cultural differences, in which sensible people from around the globe would find common solutions, if only Bush weren@-@t so unilateral. </s> <s> At first, the Bush worldview seems far more airy-fairy and idealistic. </s> <s> The man talks about God, and good versus evil. </s> <s> But in reality, Dean is the more idealistic and na@-@ve one. </s> <s> Bush at least recognizes the existence of intellectual and cultural conflict. </s> <s> He acknowledges that different value systems are incompatible. </s> <s> In the world Dean describes, people, other than a few bizarre terrorists, would be working together if not for Bush. </s> <s> In the Dean worldview, all problems are matters of technique and negotiation. </s> <s> Dean tried yesterday to show how sober and serious he could be. </s> <s> In fact, he has never appeared so much the dreamer, so clueless about the intellectual and cultural divides that really do confront us and with which real presidents have to grapple. </s> <s> By Ryan LizzaIt has long been an article of faith among Democratic strategists that their party can@-@t win the White House without at least part of the once-solidly-Democratic South. </s> <s> Since 1964, the only Democrats elected president have been Southerners, and conventional wisdom holds that only a Democrat with a Southern base can win the presidency. </s> <s> Howard Dean courted controversy in October when he talked about the need for Democrats to win Southern votes. </s> <s> But privately, Dean@-@s aides often make a different case. </s> <s> Al Gore@-@s failing in 2000, they say, was not that he couldn@-@t win in the South, but that he couldn@-@t nail down New England. </s> <s> If Gore had been able to muster a few thousand more votes in New Hampshire, he would have won the presidency without a single Southern state. </s> <s> For some Democrats, this insight has led to a heretical theory about next year@-@s presidential election: Forget the South. </s> <s> The Forget-the-South argument has little to do with anti-Dixie bias. </s> <s> Instead, it is based on simple mathematics. </s> <s> Consider the numbers. </s> <s> Democrats and Republicans agree that Bush and his eventual rival will each start the race with an ironclad base of states that are virtually unwinnable for the other party. </s> <s> Bush@-@s base is rooted in the South, plains and interior West of the country, while the Democratic nominee can take for granted most of New England, the West Coast and a smattering of the Midwest. </s> <s> Most strategists calculate that Bush can count on 20 states with 170 electoral votes, and that the Democratic candidate starts with 11 states and the District of Columbia, totaling 168 electoral votes. </s> <s> That leaves the two candidates with a battleground of just 19 swing states. </s> <s> Nine of those 19 states none of them in the South went for Clinton in 1992 and 1996 and for Gore in 2000. </s> <s> These are the blue-leaning states, and any Democratic candidate has to lock them up before dipping his toe below the Mason-Dixon line. </s> <s> Victory in all nine would increase the Democrat@-@s total to 260 electoral votes, still 10 short of victory. </s> <s> That leaves 10 red-leaning states, from which the Democratic nominee needs to scrape up those final 10 electoral votes. </s> <s> Four of them @-@Florida, Tennessee, Louisiana and Arkansas@-@ are in the South. </s> <s> The six remaining battleground states @-@Ohio, Missouri, West Virginia, Arizona, Nevada and New Hampshire@-@ are geographically situated in areas of the greatest Democratic growth and strength. </s> <s> Why, ask the proponents of the Forget-the-South strategy, waste millions of dollars fighting for the 27 electoral votes in Jeb Bush@-@s Florida when you can wrap up the election by winning the 20 in the economically battered state of Ohio?As for Tennessee, Louisiana and Arkansas, there is an argument to be made for the Democrats to fight hard in each of them, but they are less competitive than the swing states outside Dixie. </s> <s> This process of elimination leads inexorably to the Forget-the-South strategy. </s> <s> It also lets Democrats be Democrats. </s> <s> Instead of pandering to @-@as Howard Dean famously put it@-@ guys with Confederate

Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, was a primary architect of the legislation. </s> <s> Now, no politician can pick up the phone, call the head of a major corporation and say, @-@Give me a million dollars,@-@@-@ Mr. McCain said in a telephone interview. </s> <s> Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, the chief critic of the law in Congress, said that the ruling cut into the free speech rights of those who want to have a role in federal elections and that money will always find a way into the system. </s> <s> This law will not remove one dime from politics, he said in a statement. </s> <s> Many campaign finance experts agree that, after months of waiting for a Supreme Court ruling, political players who were frozen by uncertainty will slowly wade back into the system. </s> <s> The question is how many will step back in and how they will spend their money. </s> <s> Thousands of corporations, labor unions and wealthy ideologues gave about @-@500 million in soft money to the national parties in last year@-@s races. </s> <s> Some believe major donors will now direct that money to third-party organizations. </s> <s> The most prominent of these third-party groups have been formed this year to press liberal causes and have had varying fund-raising success. </s> <s> Some have yet to crack @-@50,000 in donations. </s> <s> Others, like an organization called America Coming Together, have tapped wealthy donors such as George Soros, the financier and philanthropist, and gathered pledges for more than @-@30 million. </s> <s> Though most are subject to the advertising restrictions under the new law and coordination with candidates is restricted, several of the groups plan to spend millions on large-scale efforts to register and mobilize voters. </s> <s> Soft money is not gone, Mr. McConnell said, it has just changed its address. </s> <s> Others say that as long as there are restrictions on what the groups can do with the money, they pose no threat to the new law@-@s intent. </s> <s> Mobilizing voters, they say, is far different from spending millions on television advertising. </s> <s> Either way, a battle begun earlier this year over what these groups can and cannot do may only intensify. </s> <s> Though Republicans have several of their own groups, party members began an aggressive attack on Democratic organizations earlier this year, including Congressional hearings and an appeal to the Federal Election Commission to render an opinion on what these groups can legally do. </s> <s> Both matters are still pending. </s> <s> For other organizations, the primary focus is the advertising rules, which restrict how political organizations must pay for television and radio ads. </s> <s> In general, candidates, political parties and advocacy groups using regulated hard money to pay for their ads can run them without restrictions. </s> <s> Organizations using soft money to pay for ads cannot mention or depict a candidate within 30 days of a primary, a provision that will kick in state-by-state, or within 60 days of a general election nationwide. </s> <s> Campaign finance experts say that much of the money that was spent on television in previous elections may be directed to other forms of influence that are not covered by the new law, such as direct mail, phone banks and Internet sites. </s> <s> Such is the case with the National Rifle Association. </s> <s> Wayne LaPierre, the group@-@s executive vice president, said his organization, which has some four million members and spent about @-@25 million on television advertisements in last year@-@s races, will shift its energies to other avenues. </s> <s> It will also boost efforts to raise more hard money through its political action committee, he said. </s> <s> We are going to be heard, I promise that, he said. </s> <s> We have new lines on the football field, but the game is still going to be played. </s> <s> As for the parties, both Republicans and Democrats have been functioning without soft money since November of 2002 and are retooling their fund-raising efforts to attract more hard money. </s> <s> State parties, which also fell under heavy soft money restrictions brought about by the law, are also adjusting. </s> <s> While they have more ground to cover because they relied more heavily on soft money, Democrats provided most of the support for the bill when it emerged from Congress last year. </s> <s> For years, Democrats pretended that they wanted campaign finance reform, all while relying heavily on soft money, Representative Thomas M.

C. </s> <s> A. </s> <s> @-@s hard-money limits on direct contributions to candidates, federal officeholders have commonly asked donors to make soft-money donations to national and state committees solely in order to assist federal campaigns, including the officeholder@-@s own. </s> <s> Parties kept tallies of the amounts of soft money raised by each officeholder, and the amount of money a member of Congress raised for the national political committees often affected the amount the committees gave to assist the member@-@s campaign . </s> <s> . </s> <s> . </s> <s> Even when not participating directly in the fund-raising, federal officeholders were well aware of the identities of the donors: national party committees would distribute lists of potential or actual donors, or donors themselves would report their generosity to officeholders. </s> <s> For their part, lobbyists, C.

</s> <s> The most direct threat from that source comes in the form of undisclosed favors and payoffs to elected officials, which have already been criminalized, and will be rendered no more discoverable by the legislation at issue here. </s> <s> The use of corporate wealth @-@like individual wealth@-@ to speak to the electorate is unlikely to distort elections especially if disclosure requirements tell the people where the speech is coming from. </s> <s> The premise of the First Amendment is that the American people are neither sheep nor fools, and hence fully capable of considering both the substance of the speech presented to them and its proximate and ultimate source. </s> <s> If that premise is wrong, our democracy has a much greater problem to overcome than merely the influence of amassed wealth. </s> <s> Given the premises of democracy, there is no such thing as too much speech. </s> <s> But, it is argued, quite apart from its effect upon the electorate, corporate speech in the form of contributions to the candidate@-@s campaign, or even in the form of independent expenditures supporting the candidate, engenders an obligation which is later paid in the form of greater access to the officeholder, or indeed in the form of votes on particular bills. </s> <s> Any quid-pro-quo agreement for votes would of course violate criminal law, and actual payoff votes have not even been claimed by those favoring the restrictions on corporate speech. </s> <s> It cannot be denied, however, that corporate @-@like noncorporate@-@ allies will have greater access to the officeholder, and that he will tend to favor the same causes as those who support him @-@which is usually why they supported him@-@. </s> <s> That is the nature of politics if not indeed human nature and how this can properly be considered corruption @-@or the appearance of corruption@-@ with regard to corporate allies and not with regard to other allies is beyond me. </s> <s> If the Bill of Rights had intended an exception to the freedom of speech in order to combat this malign proclivity of the officeholder to agree with those who agree with him, and to speak more with his supporters than his opponents, it would surely have said so. </s> <s> It did not do so, I think, because the juice is not worth the squeeze. </s> <s> FROM THE DISSENTBy Justice KennedyOur precedents teach, above all, that government cannot be trusted to moderate its own rules for suppression of speech. </s> <s> The dangers posed by speech regulations have led the court to insist upon principled constitutional lines and a rigorous standard of review. </s> <s> The majority now abandons these distinctions and limitations. </s> <s> Until today@-@s consolidated cases, the court has accepted but two principles to use in determining the validity of campaign finance restrictions. </s> <s> First is the anticorruption rationale. </s> <s> The principal concern, of course, is the agreement for a quid pro quo between officeholders @-@or candidates@-@ and those who would seek to influence them. </s> <s> The court has said the interest in preventing corruption allows limitations on receipt of the quid by a candidate or officeholder, regardless of who gives it or of the intent of the donor or officeholder. </s> <s> Second, the Court has analyzed laws that classify on the basis of the speaker@-@s corporate or union identity under the corporate speech rationale. </s> <s> The court has said that the willing adoption of the entity form by corporations and unions justifies regulating them differently: their ability to give candidates quids may be subject not only to limits but also to outright bans; their electoral speech may likewise be curtailed. </s> <s> The Court ignores these constitutional bounds and in effect interprets the anticorruption rationale to allow regulation not just of actual or apparent quid pro quo arrangements, but of any conduct that wins good will from or influences a member of Congress. </s> <s> It is not that there is any quarrel between this opinion and the majority that the inquiry since Buckley @-@v. Valeo, 1976@-@ has been whether certain conduct creates undue influence. </s> <s> On that we agree. </s> <s> The very aim of Buckley@-@s standard, however, was to define undue influence by reference to the presence of quid pro quo involving the officeholder. </s> <s> The court, in contrast, concludes that access, without more, proves influence is undue. </s> <s> Access, in the court@-@s view, has the same legal ramifications as actual or apparent corruption of officeholders. </s> <s> This new definition of corruption sweeps away all protections for speech that lie in its path. </s> <s> Access in itself, however, shows only that in a general sense an officeholder favors someone or that someone has influence on the officeholder. </s> <s> There is no basis, in law or in fact, to say favoritism or influence in general is the same as corrupt favoritism or influence in particular. </s> <s> By equating vague and generic claims of favoritism or influence with actual or apparent corruption, the court adopts a definition of corruption that dismantles basic First Amendment rules, permits Congress to suppress speech in the absence of a quid pro quo threat, and moves beyond the rationale that is Buckley@-@s very foundation. </s> <s> The generic favoritism or influence theory articulated by the court is at odds with standard First Amendment analyses because it is unbounded and susceptible to no limiting principle. </s> <s> FROM THE DISSENTBy Chief Justice RehnquistThe issue presented by Title I is not, as the court implies, whether Congress can permissibly regulate campaign contributions to candidates, de facto or otherwise, or seek to eliminate corruption in the political process. </s> <s> Rather, the issue is whether Congress can permissibly regulate much speech that has no plausible connection to candidate contributions or corruption to achieve those goals. </s> <s> Under our precedent, restrictions on political contributions implicate important First Amendment values and are constitutional only if they are closely drawn to reduce the corruption of federal candidates or the appearance of corruption. </s> <s> Yet, the court glosses over the breadth of the restrictions, characterizing Title I of B. C. R. A. as doing little more that regulating the ability of wealthy individuals, corporations, and unions to contribute large sums of money to influence federal elections, federal candidates, and federal officeholders. </s> <s> Because, in reality, Title I is much broader than the court allows, regulating a good deal of speech that does not have the potential to corrupt federal candidates and officeholders, I dissent. </s> <s> By Bob HerbertReady, aim. </s> <s> . </s> <s> . </s> <s> . </s> <s> The Democratic Party@-@s circular firing squad has assembled. </s> <s> Everybody@-@s angry with everybody else. </s> <s> Joe Lieberman is trying to extricate the knife that, in his view, Al Gore deposited in his back. </s> <s> Al Sharpton is accusing Mr. Gore of engaging in the kind of bossism that belongs in the other party. </s> <s> The Gore and Clinton families are morphing into the Hatfields and the McCoys. </s> <s> And the runaway Dean machine, which has shown an impressive ability to amass campaign cash and early primary support, is now generating prodigious amounts of fear and loathing as well. </s> <s> Those cackles of glee you hear in the background are coming from the White House. </s> <s> One very prominent Southern Democrat, who asked not to be identified, said of Howard Dean, This guy will take us down like the Titanic. </s> <s> Representative Charles Rangel, who endorsed Gen.

our allies, while the Democrats are let@-@s see, fumbling their way through an incoherent primary season and freaking out over Al Gore@-@s endorsement of Howard Dean. </s> <s> One of the reasons Dr. Dean is doing so much better at this point than his primary opponents has been his combativeness, his willingness to attack and bluntly confront President Bush and his policies. </s> <s> Our leaders have developed a vocabulary which has become meaningless to the American people, he said in his announcement speech in June. </s> <s> There is no greater example of this than a self-described

and disoriented by the pace of 21st-century events, new reasons to hope. </s> <s> That can only be done by a thoughtful, united, energized and creative party. </s> <s> A party with a plan and a

former governor of Vermont, from an asterisk in the polls to the man to beat for the Democratic presidential nomination. </s> <s> Mr. Trippi has revolutionized use of the Internet for political

Kenneth Blackwell, a Republican whom Democrats have accused of worsening the state@-@s voting problems in the way he interpreted state law. </s> <s> But Mr. Blackwell acknowledged that the election spotlighted the state@-@s outdated voting system, with 68 of 88 counties still relying on punch cards. </s> <s> In an interview, he called for updating voting machines, and also for early voting, multiple-day voting and other changes that he said would shorten lines and encourage people to vote. </s> <s> @-@I don@-@t think it@-@s wrong to have high expectations,@-@ he said. </s> <s> Certainly there were problems on Election Day. </s> <s> In Franklin County, a computing error initially awarded nearly 4,000 extra votes to President Bush. </s> <s> In Mahoning County, improperly calibrated touch screens resulted in an unknown number of votes incorrectly going to President Bush before the problem was caught. </s> <s> And most recently, election challengers in various Ohio counties have said that the tabulators used to count punch cards may have been tampered with before the recount. </s> <s> But experts in election law say little clear evidence of fraud has emerged. </s> <s> Democratic officials have joined Republicans in arguing that any conspiracy to deny Mr. Kerry votes would have required Democratic complicity, because each of Ohio@-@s 88 county election boards has two Democrats and two Republicans. </s> <s> Yet there were widespread problems, many of which point to defects in the election rules, experts say. </s> <s> @-@I think the problems weren@-@t sufficient to cast doubt on the results,@-@ said Edward B. Foley, director of the Election Law Program at Ohio State University@-@s law school. </s> <s> @-@But I do think there were more problems than usual in Ohio. </s> <s> @-@Provisional ballots are a prime example. </s> <s> In 2002, Congress authorized using the ballots in federal elections for voters whose names do not appear on registration rolls. </s> <s> The ballots are sealed and held until after an election, so a voter@-@s eligibility can be checked. </s> <s> Valid ballots are then counted, others discarded. </s> <s> But Congress largely left it to the states to promulgate rules for provisional ballots, resulting in a hodgepodge of policies. </s> <s> In Ohio, Mr. Blackwell, who was co-chairman of Mr. Bush@-@s state campaign, ruled that provisional ballots would be counted only when cast from a voter@-@s proper precinct. </s> <s> @-@At least 26 other states followed the same practice. </s> <s> @-@ Democrats challenged the ruling, but a federal court upheld Mr. Blackwell. </s> <s> Rules for reviewing provisional ballots also vary widely within the state. </s> <s> Some counties checked voter registration records dating back several years to validate ballots; others searched only recent records. </s> <s> Cuyahoga County, a Democratic bastion that includes Cleveland, did not check older records, and its rejection rate for provisional ballots was about 35 percent. </s> <s> The state average was 23 percent. </s> <s> Mr. Blackwell says that despite the complaints, Ohio had one of the country@-@s highest acceptance rates for provisional ballots: 77 percent of its 155,000 provisional ballots were counted, the highest in a 16-state survey by Electionline.org. </s> <s> Illinois and Pennsylvania, which went for Mr. Kerry, accepted only about half of their

Republican who is the director of elections in Franklin County, said the urban precincts lost machines because many of their voters had not voted recently and because those precincts historically had

<s> But the ones who are more politically motivated go to places like Canada. </s> <s> @-@That is certainly the reasoning behind Michelle Paymar@-@s recent decision to move to Vancouver, British

the same immigration rights as legal spouses now have. </s> <s> @-@But it was wishful thinking. </s> <s> @-@To hedge their bets, the couple recently hired a Canadian immigration lawyer and took a

Hibbs Jr., then a Harvard professor of government, nearly 80 percent of Americans had come to believe by April 1980 that government spending caused inflation. </s> <s> But if economic frustration is at least partly behind this change, then a presidential campaign that emphasized strong policies for economic growth and reviving wages might bring them back. </s> <s> Even if moral issues were the reason Mr. Kerry lost voters, economic frustration may well be behind the rise of some of these values. </s> <s> @-@It should not be surprising at all,@-@ said Richard Sennett, the New York University sociologist whose latest book is @-@Respect in a World of Inequality@-@ @-@Norton, 2003@-@. </s> <s> @-@When people are confronted with uncertain economic times, of course they would turn to cultural certainty. </s> <s> @-@Promising credible economic relief may have reduced anxieties about moral differences with the Democrats. </s> <s> But Mr. Kerry often diverted to other issues. </s> <s> There is another reason to think a good economic plan might have overcome the moral questions. </s> <s> Moral values have been an issue in several recent elections. </s> <s> As two specialists on public opinion polls, Robert J. Blendon and John M. Benson, both of Harvard University, point out, surveys of voters leaving the polls that are conducted by The Los Angeles Times have included a question about moral values since 1992. </s> <s> Voters have consistently ranked moral values as either the first or the second most important reason for making their decision. </s> <s> Yet a Democrat, Mr. Clinton, won in 1992 and 1996, and Mr. Gore won at least the popular vote in 2000. </s> <s> Mr. Kerry may not have had the same appeal on moral values, but Mr. Blendon and Mr. Benson say they also believe that a solid economic plan could have wooed more voters. </s> <s> What is the source of the Democrats@-@ inability to connect convincingly with their old base? </s> <s> The answer requires a little economic perspective. </s> <s> Despite the Clinton economic boom of the late 1990@-@s, America@-@s economic growth has been at historically low levels since the early 1970@-@s. Had this country grown at the rates that were normal in America beginning in the late 1800@-@s, revenue from federal taxes levied on that income growth would have been much higher than they are today, as economists like Martin Baily and Paul Krugman pointed out years ago. </s> <s> A reasonable estimate is that the federal government would have had at least @-@300 billion more a year to spend, and probably more. </s> <s> With more revenue for social programs, Democrats could talk like real Democrats. </s> <s> Instead, they often try to offer social programs that appear costless, like Mr. Kerry@-@s modest rules to limit the outsourcing of American jobs. </s> <s> Mr. Kerry@-@s first mistake was making the deficit the linchpin of his economic plan. </s> <s> He, like President Bush, would have cut the federal deficit in half in five years on the way to balancing the budget in 10 years. </s> <s> Even the credibility of his interesting but complex health care plan was undermined because balancing the budget would leave little, if any, room for expanding social policies. </s> <s> Mr. Kerry@-@s second error was to promise tax reductions to the middle class. </s> <s> More consistent with Mr. Kerry@-@s position would have been to claim that the American government has too much work to do to cut taxes. </s> <s> Economists at the Economic Policy Institute point out that federal taxes as a proportion of the gross domestic product now come to just over 16 percent, the lowest level since the 1950@-@s.

</s> <s> At a time when the White House has portrayed Mr. Bush@-@s 3.5-million-vote victory as a mandate, the poll found that Americans are at best ambivalent about Mr. Bush@-@s plans to reshape Social Security, rewrite the tax code, cut taxes and appoint conservative judges to the bench. </s> <s> There is continuing disapproval of Mr. Bush@-@s handling of the war in Iraq, with a plurality now saying it was a mistake to invade in the first place. </s> <s> While Democrats, not surprisingly, were the staunchest opponents of many elements of Mr. Bush@-@s second-term agenda, the concerns extended across party lines in some cases. </s> <s> Nearly two-thirds of all respondents including 51 percent of Republicans said it was more important to reduce deficits than to cut taxes, a central element of Mr. Bush@-@s economic agenda. </s> <s> The poll also found pervasive concern about what Americans view as the corrosive effect Hollywood and popular culture have on the nation@-@s values and moral standards. </s> <s> Seventy percent said they were very or somewhat concerned that television, movies and popular music were lowering moral standards in this country. </s> <s> While this sentiment was voiced by supporters of Mr. Bush and of Mr. Kerry, it appears that the concern about a decline in values is becoming another point of polarization in American politics. </s> <s> Mr. Bush@-@s supporters were more likely to cite it than were Mr. Kerry@-@s voters, and it was an issue that had particular resonance in the South and among weekly churchgoers, rural voters and women. </s> <s> The poll found that 55 percent of Mr. Kerry@-@s supporters said that Mr. Bush@-@s supporters did not share their views and morals; 54 percent of Mr. Bush@-@s voters said the same thing of those who voted for Mr. Kerry. </s> <s> In addition, 70 percent of Mr. Kerry@-@s supporters said they were more worried about candidates who @-@are too close to religion and religious leaders@-@ than about political leaders who @-@don@-@t pay enough attention@-@ to religion, after a campaign in which Mr. Bush repeatedly spoke of God and his faith. </s> <s> By contrast, 52 percent of Mr. Bush@-@s supporters said they were more worried about public officials who @-@don@-@t pay enough attention to religion and religious leaders. </s> <s> @-@Still, in a telling contrast with the 2000 election, 82 percent of respondents said that Mr. Bush legitimately won on Nov. 2. </s> <s> Just before Election Day, 50 percent of respondents said they considered Mr. Bush@-@s defeat of Al Gore in 2000 a legitimate victory. </s> <s> And even after this tense and vituperative campaign, 56 percent said they were generally optimistic about the next four years under Mr. Bush. </s> <s> Mr. Bush@-@s job approval rating has now inched up to 51 percent, the highest it has been since March. </s> <s> The Times@-@CBS News poll was taken from Thursday through Sunday, after a three-week period in which some pollsters questioned some findings of the survey of voters leaving polling places on Election Day. </s> <s> The nationwide telephone poll of 855 adults has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. </s> <s> The poll reflected the electoral feat of the Bush campaign this year. </s> <s> He won despite the fact that Americans disapproved of his handling of the economy, foreign affairs and the war in Iraq. </s> <s> There has been a slight increase in the number of Americans who believe the nation should never have gone into Iraq. </s> <s> A majority of Americans continue to believe the country is going in the wrong direction, traditionally a warning sign for an incumbent. </s> <s> Across the board, the poll suggested that the outcome of the election reflected a determination by Americans that they trusted Mr. Bush more to protect them against future terrorist attacks and that they liked him more than Mr. Kerry rather than any kind of broad affirmation of his policies. </s> <s> As such, the result was reminiscent of the state of play Ronald Reagan found in 1980, when he defeated President Jimmy Carter. </s> <s> Even as two-thirds of respondents said they expected Mr. Bush to appoint judges who would vote to outlaw abortion, a majority continue to say they want the practice to remain either legal as it is now, which was Mr. Kerry@-@s position, or to be legal but under stricter limits. </s> <s> Americans said they opposed changing the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage, which Mr. Bush campaigned on in the final weeks of his campaign. </s> <s> A majority continue to support allowing either same-sex marriages or legally recognized domestic partnerships for gay people. </s> <s> The public appears ambivalent about the two proposals that Mr. Bush has identified as his major domestic initiatives for a second term: rewriting the Social Security system and reshaping the tax code, including more tax cuts. </s> <s> On the tax code, administration officials are discussing plans that would, among other things, lower the tax rate on higher-income Americans and eliminate some deductions. </s> <s> In the poll, more than 6 in 10 of the respondents said people with higher incomes should pay a greater proportion of their income in taxes; 3 in 10 said all income groups should pay the same proportion. </s> <s> About one-third of the respondents said the tax cuts passed in Mr. Bush@-@s first term had been good for the economy; but nearly a fifth said they had done more harm, and just under half said the tax cuts had made little difference. </s> <s> @-@I don@-@t mind cutting taxes to some extent, but I think we@-@ve cut them quite a bit,@-@ Ron Clark, 63, a Republican from Livingston, Mont., said in a follow-up interview. </s> <s> @-@I@-@m not really against making the current reductions permanent, but I don@-@t think we need to go beyond where we@-@ve gone, because I do worry about the deficit. </s> <s> It@-@s gone up a heck of a lot in the last couple of years. </s> <s> @-@On Social Security, 45 percent said a proposal to permit people to invest their Social Security withholding money in private accounts was a bad idea; 49 percent said it was a good idea. </s> <s> The poll also found little confidence among Americans that Mr. Bush would assure the future solvency of the program: 51 percent said that Mr. Bush was unlikely to @-@make sure Social Security benefits are there for people like me. </s> <s> @-@Among the disputed results of the Election Day survey of voters was the finding that moral issues were critical in determining the outcome. </s> <s> That survey found that 22 percent of respondents called it the most critical issue in making their decision. </s> <s> Some pollsters criticized the way the question was asked because it was presented as a general category, without any kind of explanation, along with a list of six other specific issues, including Iraq and health care. </s> <s> In this poll, when allowed freely to name the issue that was most important in their vote, 6 percent chose moral values, although smaller numbers named issues like abortion and same-sex marriage. </s> <s> On a separate question in which voters were given a choice of nine issues, 5 percent chose abortion, 4 percent chose stem cell research and 2 percent chose same-sex marriage. </s> <s> The top issue was the economy and jobs, which was cited by 29 percent of respondents. </s> <s> That said, there is a little question that Americans have grown increasingly unhappy with the influence of popular culture on daily life, and that was a significant dynamic in this election. </s> <s> Nearly two-thirds of respondents said that Hollywood was lowering the standard of popular culture. </s> <s> And 70 percent said that all popular culture music, movies and television was lowering moral standards in America. </s> <s> The poll also found, though, that Americans were evenly divided on whether television, movies and books were including too many gay themes and characters. </s> <s> The poll and follow-up interviews found that Bush supporters and Kerry supporters were in different camps on these issues, eyeing each other with suspicion. </s> <s> @-@I think they@-@re driven by hatred and homophobia and vitriol,@-@ said Paul Cuthbertson, 53, a Democrat from Atlanta. </s> <s> @-@The Republicans in recent years have turned @-@liberal@-@ into a dirty word, which it isn@-@t. I@-@m a liberal and proud to be so. </s> <s> This so-called Christian ideal of being against gay marriage is neither American nor Christian. </s> <s> I think it@-@s un-American to discriminate against fellow citizens, and God does not call upon Christians to be vigilantes to punish people that they perceive him not to like. </s> <s> @-@Pat Gilbert, a Republican from Battle Creek, Mich., said, @-@The two sides will be as far apart as can be forever. </s> <s> @-@I@-@m sure there are different pockets of voters who voted for Kerry, but I think they believe more in society in general if you@-@re not hurting anybody it@-@s all right to do it,@-@ Ms. Gilbert said, adding: @-@I don@-@t think they have a firm belief system that they base decisions off of. </s> <s> It@-@s whatever today@-@s climate is. </s> <s> In the long term, you@-@ll have a society of chaos. </s> <s> @-@By 48 percent to 40 percent, respondents said they believed four more years of a Bush presidency would divide the nation more than it would unite it. </s> <s> For all the attention paid to the effort Mr. Bush made to increase his support from religious supporters, 31 percent of respondents said they thought that evangelical Christians had too much influence over the administration. </s> <s> By contrast, 66 percent said they thought big business had too much influence over the administration. </s> <s> Finally, in one bit of presumably good news for a party that is looking for it, Americans now have a better opinion of the Democratic Party than of the Republican Party: 54 percent said they had a favorable view of Democrats, compared with 39 percent with an unfavorable view. </s> <s> By contrast, 49 percent have a favorable view of Republicans, compared with 46 percent holding an unfavorable one. </s> <s> Chart: @-@Public Perceptions of Domestic Issues@-@SOCIAL SECURITY George W.

of the brightest spots in this year@-@s election was the nationwide debut of the provisional ballot. </s> <s> In 2000, many voters were turned away if their names were not on the rolls, even if they should have been. </s> <s> This year, any voter whose eligibility was in doubt had the right to cast a ballot whose validity would be determined later. </s> <s> This was a major improvement, but provisional ballots were still less effective than they should have been because of misguided rules at the state level. </s> <s> Congress and the states should fix the flaws in the system. </s> <s> The guarantee of provisional ballots was one of the few valuable reforms in the Help America Vote Act, which Congress passed after 2000. </s> <s> Hundreds of thousands of voters used these ballots this year. </s> <s> In Colorado, more than 50,000 were cast, of which more than three-quarters were found to be valid. </s> <s> In Ohio, there were more than 155,000 provisional ballots, though it remains unclear how many will be counted. </s> <s> Unfortunately, Congress left decisions about which provisional ballots would be counted to the states, which adopted some bad rules. </s> <s> Many decided to throw out provisional ballots cast in the wrong polling place. </s> <s> Such a rule ignores the fact that many voters are in the wrong place because elections officials have misdirected them, or never told them where to vote. </s> <s> One Missouri man who tried to vote this year went to four polling places. </s> <s> At each one, poll workers told him he was in the wrong polling place, but they could not tell him where to go. </s> <s> At the fourth polling place, he cast a provisional ballot that was thrown out because he was registered at a fifth. </s> <s> The reasons given for throwing out provisional ballots cast at the wrong polling place are weak. </s> <s> The rule is said to deter @-@convenience voting,@-@ people voting wherever they please. </s> <s> But there is no evidence this would be a huge problem, and in any case, the solution throwing out valid votes is worse. </s> <s> It is sometimes said that counting provisional ballots cast at the wrong polling place increases the risk of fraud, though there is no reason it should in a well-run election system. </s> <s> Congress should make clear that provisional ballots count if they are cast in any polling place in the jurisdiction, and states that have adopted the wrong-polling-place rule should rescind it. </s> <s> Another problem is the lack of uniform standards nationally, and even within states, for counting provisional ballots. </s> <s> In 2002, a close Congressional race in Colorado ended up in court because the three counties in the district each had different standards for which provisional ballots were valid. </s> <s> Rather than continuing to invite postelection litigation over whether ballots with small defects should be thrown out, Congress should adopt uniform national standards. </s> <s> Failing that, states should adopt a statewide standard. </s> <s> On Election Day, there were scattered reports of voters being turned away without being offered a provisional ballot. </s> <s> In other cases, voters who should have been given regular ballots may have been required to cast provisional ballots, which have a greater chance of being disqualified. </s> <s> Local election officials should improve poll worker training, and recruit better poll workers, to fix this problem. </s> <s> This year, the provisional ballot proved to be a valuable reform. </s> <s> There is still work to be done, however, before it delivers on its promise that every eligible voter who shows up on Election Day will be allowed to cast a ballot that counts. </s> <s> By Hilary Rosen Hillary

</s> <s> @-@ I asked. </s> <s> @-@Don@-@t know,@-@ Bouchard shrugged, prompting the actress herself, apparently blessed with good hearing, to turn around and appraise us coldly. </s> <s> @-@ Now, on election morning, he surveyed the ballroom. </s> <s> @-@I don@-@t care where these people are from,@-@ he said, @-@as long as they@-@re motivated. </s> <s> @-@Field organizers are the invisible heroes of any political campaign, the grunts who rarely get credit, and they fall into two categories: the first includes the bookish spreadsheet fiends who love nothing more than to transform urban tracts into streams of relevant voting data; the second comprises the kind of oddball extroverts whose idea of a good time is to entertain a total stranger at the doorstep of his own home. </s> <s> Bouchard fell into the latter category. </s> <s> He was likely, at any moment, to break into a blues standard or into a well-practiced imitation of Tom Brokaw. </s> <s> In his pocket, he carried for good luck a New England Patriots pendant that was given to him by the team@-@s owner, Robert Kraft, during a chance encounter. </s> <s> He had walked up to the man in the lobby of the Plaza Hotel in New York City and started chatting him up, as if Kraft were just another voter waiting to be registered. </s> <s> Bouchard had molded an impressive, almost military operation. </s> <s> He took over Ohio from a previous director last April, after running field operations for Bob Graham and then Wesley Clark in each man@-@s failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. </s> <s> Bouchard inherited a sprawling network of some 25 field offices and a payroll of 800 canvassers. </s> <s> Before he arrived, ACT was quickly exhausting its budget for Ohio, and, worse, Bouchard observed, it wasn@-@t converting enough voters to justify the expense. </s> <s> The reason, he figured, was practical: since ACT, as a 527, was legally barred from advocating for a specific candidate, it was impossible for ACT canvassers to make a compelling case for Kerry. </s> <s> They were allowed to tell a voter that, say, a lot of jobs had disappeared from Ohio in the last four years, but they weren@-@t able to explain what Kerry intended to do about it. </s> <s> Bouchard closed almost a third of the offices and pared down his canvassing staff by two-thirds. </s> <s> His team then focused its efforts on signing up new voters in heavily Democratic areas where a lot of new and transient voters had yet to register. </s> <s> Using Palm Pilots equipped with 30-second video ads to show to prospective voters, the canvassers set about identifying voters across the state: where they lived, how they planned to vote, what issues they cared about. </s> <s> Even building an up-to-date list of previously registered voters was a monstrous assignment in Ohio, because voters in the state don@-@t register with a party affiliation; the only thing canvassers knew about their political orientations before knocking on their doors was whether they had voted in either party@-@s primary in the last six years. </s> <s> Every night, without fail, the canvassers plugged their Palm Pilots, full of new data about the homes they had visited, into ACT@-@s Web-based voter list. </s> <s> By Election Day, ACT claimed to have registered 85,000 new voters in Ohio, while the rest of the America Votes coalition groups as large as the A. F. L.-C. </s> <s> I. O. and MoveOn.org and as small as Music for America had registered another 215,000. </s> <s> If you were an Ohioan registered by ACT or one of its partners, Bouchard told me, you were contacted as many as a dozen times after you registered, by phone or by mail or by a live canvasser at your front door. </s> <s> ACT claimed to have knocked on 3.7 million doors and held more than 1.1 million doorstep conversations in the state; in contrast, the Kerry-Edwards campaign, which had its own significant turnout effort under way, had arrived in Ohio months after ACT and reported having knocked on about 595,000 doors. </s> <s> @-@There@-@s no way a party or a campaign could put on the ground the resources that we have,@-@ Bouchard told me. </s> <s> @-@The sheer numbers of doors we knock on and phone calls we make are just astounding. </s> <s> @-@Earlier in the year, I had spent weeks on the other side of the lines in Ohio, writing an article for the magazine about the Republican plan to vastly increase turnout using an all-volunteer network, modeled on a multilevel marketing scheme like Amway, that would focus on the new and growing exurban counties around Ohio@-@s major cities. </s> <s> Democrats, traditionally the masters of field organizing, had dismissed the Republican effort as an exercise in self-delusion, insisting that volunteers could never build a turnout model to compete with professional organizers. </s> <s> In ACT and its partners, Democrats told me, they were building the most efficient turnout machine in political history. </s> <s> I returned to Ohio in the final days of the campaign to see the power of this grass-roots behemoth in action. </s> <s> I did and I came to understand its limitations as well. </s> <s> But all of that was still hours away as canvassers clutched their marching orders and streamed out of the little ballroom on Main Street. </s> <s> Soon Bouchard and I were the only ones left. </s> <s> @-@I@-@m thinking I@-@ve got to go,@-@ he said finally. </s> <s> @-@Except what have I got to do? </s> <s> I@-@m going back to the office to see what@-@s going on, I guess. </s> <s> @-@ We walked down to the street. </s> <s> The polls were open and the sun had risen, although Bouchard, blinking at the sky, could see the stirrings of storm clouds. </s> <s> This worried him; rain is always assumed to deter urban voters. </s> <s> He had been watching weather forecasts for weeks, and the latest report all but assured him of showers. </s> <s> Bouchard changed his mind about the office. </s> <s> @-@I@-@m going to vote,@-@ he said.10 a.m. After breakfast, I called Steve Rosenthal on his cellphone. </s> <s> Rosenthal, ACT@-@s chief executive officer and Bou-chard@-@s boss, had been lent a private jet for the closing days of the campaign by one of the group@-@s wealthy donors. </s> <s> He touched down the night before in Cincinnati, and now he was driving his rental car from Dayton to Columbus. </s> <s> @-@I@-@m just blown away by what I see everywhere I go,@-@ he told me. </s> <s> @-@It@-@s raining, but our people aren@-@t deterred. </s> <s> They@-@re voting. </s> <s> They@-@re organizing. </s> <s> They@-@re canvassing. </s> <s> It@-@s amazing. </s> <s> I really think we could win by a substantial margin. </s> <s> @-@ACT represented Rosenthal@-@s vision more than anyone else@-@s. Ellen Malcolm, the influential president of Emily@-@s List, had done the most to raise the money, but it was Rosenthal, the former political director of the A. F. L.-C. </s> <s> I. O. and a labor department official in the Clinton administration, who was known inside the party as a brilliant, almost legendary field strategist. </s> <s> Perpetually rumpled and self-effacing, more studious than brazen, Rosenthal wasn@-@t the kind of guy given to bold pronouncements. </s> <s> But everything in his experience told him the election was well within reach for Kerry. </s> <s> He had taken to repeating a football analogy that came from Andrew Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, who had dispatched thousands of the union@-@s members and employees to work on ACT@-@s behalf: ACT, Stern said, had assembled the best field-goal unit ever. </s> <s> All the candidate had to do was get them into range, and they would do the rest. </s> <s> @-@For the life of me, I can@-@t see how we could lose Ohio,@-@ Rosenthal had told me over lunch in Washington the previous week. </s> <s> @-@The only way they win Ohio is to steal it like they did Florida four years ago. </s> <s> @-@Rosenthal, wearing jeans and sneakers, arrived at ACT@-@s Ohio headquarters to hugs and handshakes from old friends and volunteers. </s> <s> He and I jumped into a Ford Explorer driven by Tom Lindenfeld, one of Rosenthal@-@s oldest friends, who was helping to direct ACT@-@s Ohio campaign. </s> <s> As we drove, Rosenthal explained to me what he had learned about elections as a union organizer. </s> <s> He had increased turnout among union members at a time when the union rolls themselves were shrinking, and he had done it by focusing on new registrants. </s> <s> Union members could be persuaded to vote, Rosenthal found, when an informed canvasser came to their doors and talked to them about the issues. </s> <s> More cerebral than your average political operative, Rosenthal had taken an interest in the work of a couple of Yale professors, Alan Gerber and Donald Green, who reported in controlled studies that door-to-door visits were far and away the most effective way to get people to vote. </s> <s> The Democratic Party had a different approach, as I learned just the day before. </s> <s> I had driven over to the Kerry campaign@-@s Ohio headquarters; it was only a five-minute drive from ACT@-@s office, and yet so complete was the separation between the campaign and the 527@-@s that no one in the ACT office seemed to know where it was. </s> <s> @-@The campaign@-@s Ohio spokeswoman, Jennifer Palmieri, told me that the only time Kerry operatives had stumbled across ACT@-@s work in the state was when they went to rent vans for Election Day and found that ACT had beaten them to it. </s> <s> @-@ Talking to Palmieri, one of the party@-@s most senior press aides, it was clear that the party and its candidate did not share Rosenthal@-@s vision. </s> <s> Given the finite resources of any campaign, she said, @-@field people generally feel that registering new voters isn@-@t a good use of time. </s> <s> It takes a lot of energy and time to register new voters, and you know they don@-@t come out to vote. </s> <s> @-@ Instead, she told me, the Democrats@-@ campaign in Ohio had adopted the old-fashioned strategy of counting @-@hard yeses. </s> <s> @-@ They found stalwart Democratic voters the base and pounded them with mail, phone calls and visits to make sure they went to the polls. </s> <s> ACT, on the other hand, reflected Rosenthal@-@s dream: he could take what he had started in the labor movement, this push for new voters, and expand it into a national turnout program that was entirely separate from the party and over which the party had no control. </s> <s> He had run a field test in Philadelphia during the 2003 mayoral election, and the data were impressive. </s> <s> ACT had registered and then canvassed 87,000 new black voters in the city, and an estimated 38,000 of them or 44 percent voted on Election Day. </s> <s> By comparison, among new voters who had registered through other means, like the state@-@s motor-voter program, turnout was at 30 percent. </s> <s> @-@You really can expand the electorate, and that@-@s what I think we have to do,@-@ Rosenthal told me as Lindenfeld pulled into the parking garage of the Holiday Inn near the Ohio State campus. </s> <s> @-@You talk to people who don@-@t vote, and what we@-@ve found is that nobody asked them to. </s> <s> Well, no one will have that excuse in this election. </s> <s> @-@In a ballroom inside the otherwise empty hotel, about 200 canvassers and van drivers the day@-@s second wave were assembled for last-minute training. </s> <s> The drivers, who would get @-@100 for the day@-@s work, were deputized to oversee their teams; each one was given a Nextel pager to communicate with headquarters. </s> <s> It was the driver@-@s job to make sure that the canvassing teams hit every door on their route, affixing a giant Post-it note reminding residents to vote. </s> <s> @-@The Post-it notes, it turned out, could be used only in the afternoon, because they wouldn@-@t stick to doors covered with morning dew. </s> <s> @-@ Hundreds of yellow ponchos were piled up to protect workers from the rain. </s> <s> Rosenthal and I watched from the side as his creation came to life. </s> <s> @-@Once you do this, there@-@s no going back,@-@ he said. </s> <s> @-@One of the by-products of this election is this whole new generation of organizers who know how to cut turf, develop lists, use them to target voters. </s> <s> They know how to do these things now. </s> <s> This is how politics changes. </s> <s> @-@We all moved on to Champps for lunch, where Rosenthal got a call from his office on his cellphone and began taking down the numbers from the first wave of exit polling. </s> <s> Kerry was up by 4 points in Ohio and Florida. </s> <s> He led by 12 in Pennsylvania. </s> <s> @-@These look great,@-@ Rosenthal told Lindenfeld and Bouchard. </s> <s> @-@I@-@ll take these. </s> <s> @-@ The three men wondered why it was that they hadn@-@t seen much evidence of the vaunted Republican turnout effort. </s> <s> The @-@vote challengers@-@ that Republicans had successfully appealed to the courts to allow into the polls had never shown up. </s> <s> Field offices weren@-@t detecting any sign of Bush canvassers on the streets or at the polls. </s> <s> It was as if all this talk about the Republicans@-@ volunteer-driven machine had been some kind of a strategic feint rather than an actual plan. </s> <s> On the way back to headquarters, where he would say his goodbyes before returning to Washington, Rosenthal saw two ACT workers standing in the rain, shielding their Post-it notes under their ponchos. </s> <s> He rolled down the window. </s> <s> @-@Hey guys, great job! </s> <s> @-@ he said. </s> <s> @-@Keep up the good work! </s> <s> @-@ The volunteers waved. </s> <s> @-@Have you seen any Republicans? </s> <s> @-@ Rosenthal asked. </s> <s> @-@No? </s> <s> They gave up, I guess. </s> <s> They@-@re all back in Crawford, at the celebration. </s> <s> @-@3 p.m. Lindenfeld and Bouchard were back on the road, checking out target precincts to make sure they were being canvassed. </s> <s> We rolled slowly through poor, all-black neighborhoods in Lindenfeld@-@s rented Ford Explorer, eyeing front porches for Post-it notes and ACT flyers. </s> <s> This is how white Democrats have always won elections in close states like Ohio by cajoling every last black urban voter to go to the polls. </s> <s> In Ohio, Republicans have been able to count on winning somewhere around 75 of the state@-@s 88 counties in any statewide election. </s> <s> The traditional Democratic formula for victory centered on a handful of counties with a heavy concentration of minority voters: win the critical stronghold of Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, by a margin of more than 150,000 votes; stay close in Franklin County, which contains Columbus and its suburbs; and hold the Republicans to a margin of victory of fewer than 60,000 votes in Hamilton County, the area that encompasses Cincinnati. </s> <s> @-@As it turned out, Democrats in 2004 would easily meet these criteria, and then some. </s> <s> Kerry won Cuyahoga by more than 217,000 votes, narrowly won Franklin, and in Hamilton lost to Bush by fewer than 25,000 votes. </s> <s> @-@Our S. U. V. passed by polling places where people waited in line around the block, umbrellas perched over their heads. </s> <s> @-@Look at that,@-@ Lindenfeld motioned to me. </s> <s> @-@Out the door and around the block. </s> <s> It@-@s a beautiful thing. </s> <s> @-@ The rule of politics had always been the same: the more people who turned out, the better it was for Democrats. </s> <s> Bouchard and Lindenfeld had been working side by side for weeks, and by now, whenever they shared the same space, a kind of dramatic tension surrounded them. </s> <s> They were like mismatched conspirators in a common struggle. </s> <s> Bouchard, the natural performer with a comedic gift, tended to lighten the atmosphere of every room he entered. </s> <s> Lindenfeld, who grew up in New Jersey and was schooled in urban politics, came off like a human machine gun, given to bravado; Rosenthal had described him to me as @-@the best street fighter in the business. </s> <s> @-@ Lindenfeld kept the earpiece for his cellphone planted in his ear at all times, with an activation trigger on his belt, so that he was constantly barking into the phone without any apparent provocation. </s> <s> You might be talking to him, face to face, when suddenly he would shout, @-@How you feelin@-@?! </s> <s> @-@ and it would take a moment to realize that he had moved on to someone else. </s> <s> @-@Are these the numbers you have? </s> <s> @-@ Lindenfeld asked, passing his BlackBerry over to Bouchard. </s> <s> The newest exit-poll data was leaking out. </s> <s> @-@Yes,@-@ Bouchard said, then paused. </s> <s> @-@Wait. </s> <s> Tommy, where@-@s Ohio? </s> <s> Ohio isn@-@t even in here. </s> <s> There@-@s no Ohio. </s> <s> Why do you do this to me? </s> <s> @-@ He stared at Lindenfeld. </s> <s> @-@Why do you hate freedom? </s> <s> @-@The newest numbers, in fact, showed the race in Ohio tightening to within 2 points. </s> <s> Bouchard still believed Ohio was Kerry@-@s, but he was less relaxed than he had been an hour before, when he had stopped to buy cigars for later, just in case. </s> <s> And with the lines at urban polling places came a new problem: in a few hours, the polls would close, and thousands of voters, most of them presumably Democrats, would be standing out in the rain until late at night, waiting to vote. </s> <s> They couldn@-@t be allowed to just give up and go home. </s> <s> Bouchard ordered his staff at headquarters to send out volunteers with ponchos and meals for the voters waiting their turn. </s> <s> @-@I want to make sure we keep the people in line warm, happy, fed and dry,@-@ he said. </s> <s> Lindenfeld, on his phone, was working out a deal. </s> <s> @-@We can feed some people,@-@ he told Bouchard. </s> <s> If ACT, which was almost out of money, would write a check for @-@3,000 to McDonald@-@s for vanloads of hot meals, the A.

K.@-@d the deal. </s> <s> What gnawed at Bouchard was that nowhere we went in Franklin County, a vigorously contested swing county, did we see any hint of a strong Republican presence no signs, no door-knockers, no Bush supporters handing out leaflets at the polls. </s> <s> This seemed only to increase Lindenfeld@-@s confidence. </s> <s> He didn@-@t believe in the Republican turnout plan. </s> <s> @-@What they talked about is a dream,@-@ he told me at one point. </s> <s> @-@We@-@ve got the reality. </s> <s> They@-@re wishing they had what we@-@ve got. </s> <s> @-@ For Bouchard, however, the silence was unsettling. </s> <s> How could there be such a thing as a stealth get-out-the-vote drive?Bouchard decided that he wanted to drive to an outlying Republican area to see if turnout there was keeping pace with the city. </s> <s> Maybe the Bush campaign was waging a more visible effort in nonurban precincts. </s> <s> Obliging him, Lindenfeld punched a few keys on his in-dash navigation system and set a course for Delaware County, a fast-growing exurban tract north of Columbus where Republicans dominate. </s> <s> Traffic thickened as we found our way onto Route 23, lined with brand-new strip plazas and office parks. </s> <s> The sky dimmed to a shade of charcoal. </s> <s> Storm clouds massed and then erupted, dumping sheets of cold rain onto the Explorer@-@s windshield. </s> <s> The mood in the car seemed to darken as well. </s> <s> @-@This is not good,@-@ Lindenfeld said, turning up the wipers. </s> <s> Kerry@-@s early lead in the exit polls should have been widening as daytime turned to night; according to the time-honored rules of politics, Republicans vote in the morning, while Democrats vote late. </s> <s> Instead, the polls suggested that whatever lead Kerry still had was fading, and the long delays at urban polling places, with the rain now bearing down, seemed to present a distinct disadvantage. </s> <s> Lindenfeld and Bouchard worked their cellphones simultaneously. </s> <s> @-@Listen,@-@ Lindenfeld barked, by way of starting a conversation, @-@the latest poll numbers we heard showed Ohio dead even. </s> <s> So you need to get back on the cellphone and work the Nextel pagers and make sure no one comes back early and punks out on their routes. </s> <s> @-@Lindenfeld dialed a new number and talked as he changed lanes: @-@Listen, it@-@s now dead even where we were up before, so we need to make sure we get these people out there, O. K.? </s> <s> We@-@re in an all-out, squeeze-it-out, make-sure-we-get-every-vote-out-there type deal. </s> <s> @-@Bouchard was talking to someone in Cleveland. </s> <s> @-@Hey, how@-@s the weather? </s> <s> @-@ he said. </s> <s> @-@What do you hear? </s> <s> @-@As night fell, we reached the city of Delaware and found a polling place at a recreation center. </s> <s> The only people in the parking lot were a drenched couple holding Kerry-Edwards signs. </s> <s> Inside, the polling place was empty. </s> <s> @-@Look at this,@-@ Lindenfeld said to me triumphantly. </s> <s> @-@Does this look like a busy polling place? </s> <s> Look around. </s> <s> There@-@s no one here. </s> <s> @-@ He repeated this several times, making the point that turnout in the outlying areas was tailing off, while voters were lined up around the block back in Columbus. </s> <s> @-@Do you see any Republicans? </s> <s> @-@ he asked me, motioning around the parking lot. </s> <s> In fact, a quick investigation of the voter rolls, taped to the wall outside the voting area, indicated that the polling place was dead for a less encouraging reason: most of the voters in the two precincts assigned to the recreation center had already voted. </s> <s> The officials in charge told me that 1,175 of the 1,730 registered voters on the rolls had cast their ballots. </s> <s> In other words, turnout in those precincts was up to an impressive 68 percent, and there were still two hours left before the polls closed. </s> <s> @-@When it was over, Delaware County as a whole would post an astounding turnout rate of 78 percent, with two out of three votes going to Bush. </s> <s> @-@I was beginning to understand that the rules of the game were changing, confounding even the experts who seemed to have this business of voter turnout all figured out. </s> <s> For decades, Democratic operatives had been virtually unchallenged by Republicans when it came to mobilizing voters, and during that time, they had come to rely on a certain set of underlying assumptions, all of them based on experience in urban areas. </s> <s> One was that the volume of activity at a polling place was a reliable measure of turnout; long lines meant higher turnout, and no lines meant disaster. </s> <s> Another was that the strength of a get-out-the-vote program could be gauged by the number of people canvassing city streets, the people holding signs in the rain, vans carrying voters to the polls. </s> <s> But Ohio, like much of the country, was undergoing a demographic shift of historic proportions, and Republicans were learning to exploit their advantage in rapidly expanding rural areas that organizers like Lindenfeld, for all their technological innovation, just didn@-@t understand. </s> <s> In shiny new town-house communities, canvassing could be done quietly by neighbors; you didn@-@t need vans and pagers. </s> <s> Polling places could accommodate all the voters in a precinct without ever giving the appearance of being overrun. </s> <s> In the old days, these towns and counties had been nothing but little pockets of voters, and Republicans hadn@-@t bothered to expend the energy to organize them. </s> <s> But now the exurban populations had reached critical mass @-@Delaware County alone had grown by almost one-third since the 2000 election@-@, and Republicans were building their own kind of quiet but ruthlessly efficient turnout machine. </s> <s> Even on the outer edges of the cities, long lines were not necessarily the indicators of Democratic muscle that they used to be. </s> <s> Returning to the headquarters in Columbus, we passed a polling place at the local fish and wildlife office, where a line of voters stretched around the building, even though the polls were closing. </s> <s> @-@You see that?

48 percent believed that the United States has a special protection from God; 54 percent said they had an @-@unfavorable@-@ view of atheists. </s> <s> And religious expression in the United States seems to have grown, not diminished, with socio-economic development. </s> <s> According to Roger Finke, a sociologist at Pennsylvania State University, in 1890, 45 percent of Americans were members of a church. </s> <s> By 2000, that figure was 62 percent. </s> <s> @-@Secularism only holds in Europe,@-@ said Peter Berger, professor emeritus of religion, sociology and theology at Boston University. </s> <s> Professor Berger was once a prominent proponent of the @-@secularization@-@ model of development. </s> <s> But he has switched to the supply-side view. </s> <s> This posits that demand for religion has little to do with economic development. </s> <s> Instead, what creates change is the supply of religious services. </s> <s> That is, Americans are more churchgoing and pious than Germans or Canadians because the United States has the most open religious market, with dozens of religious denominations competing vigorously to offer their flavor of salvation, becoming extremely responsive to the needs of their parishes. </s> <s> @-@There@-@s a lack of regulation restricting churches, so in this freer market there is a larger supply,@-@ said Mr. Finke. </s> <s> The suppliers of religion then try to stoke demand. </s> <s> @-@The potential demand for religion has to be activated,@-@ said Rodney Stark, a sociologist at Baylor University. </s> <s> @-@The more members of the clergy that are out there working to expand their congregations the more people will go to church.@-@Mr. </s> <s> Finke notes that this free-market theory also fits well with the explosion of religion across Latin America, where the weakening of the longstanding Catholic monopoly has led to all sorts of evangelical Christian churches and to an overall increase of religious expression. </s> <s> The supply-siders say their model even explains secular Europe. </s> <s> Europeans, they argue, are fundamentally just as religious as Americans, with similar metaphysical concerns, but they suffer from a uncompetitive market lazy, quasi-monopolistic churches that have been protected from competition by the state. </s> <s> @-@Wherever you@-@ve got a state church, you have empty churches,@-@ Mr. Stark said. </s> <s> The free-market argument is not absolutely watertight, however. </s> <s> Islamic states, for instance, have very strong quasi-state churches and high religious participation. </s> <s> And some European sociologists argue that there is much more religious competition in Europe than the supply-siders acknowledge. </s> <s> And in the United States, the most religious states and counties are those most dominated by a single denomination Mormon, Baptist or Pentecostal not those where there is most competition, Mr. Voas said. </s> <s> Whatever its shortcomings, the free-market theory might also offer solace for those concerned about the creeping influence of religion in American government. </s> <s> That@-@s because the theory posits that for religion to thrive, it must remain clearly separate from the state. </s> <s> @-@Our pluralism helps religion expand,@-@ said Gary Wills, the historian. </s> <s> @-@The separation of church and state protected religion from anticlericalism. </s> <s> @-@Correction: November 28, 2004, Sunday A chart last Sunday illustrating some of the country@-@s cultural differences mislabeled the data for abortions. </s> <s> They represented abortions per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44, not per 1,000 births. </s> <s> The abortion data excluded Alaska, California, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana and New Hampshire, for which insufficient statistics were available. </s> <s> The divorce data excluded California, Hawaii, Indiana, Louisiana and Oklahoma for the same reason. </s> <s> THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 11-21-04By Jim HoltCorrection AppendedWhen George W.

</s> <s> The reason is simple. </s> <s> There are big differences among the states, as the last election showed differences in their understanding of tolerance, in their attitude toward the role of religion in public life, in the value they place on education, conservation and scientific research. </s> <s> The more sovereignty each state has, the better it can pursue policies that are appropriate to the needs and preferences of its people. </s> <s> Marriage affords a vivid example. </s> <s> In some states it is evidently more imperiled than in others. </s> <s> The Bible Belt states, in particular, have a shockingly high divorce rate, around 50 percent above the national average. </s> <s> Given such marital instability, these states are anxious to defend the institution of heterosexual matrimony, which may explain their hostility to gay marriage. </s> <s> The state of Massachusetts, by contrast, has the lowest divorce rate in the nation. </s> <s> So its people or at least its liberal judges perhaps feel more comfortable allowing some progressive experimentation. </s> <s> It will be interesting to see how this experiment plays out, assuming the Bush administration does not succeed in choking off the right of a state to recognize same-sex marriages by getting the Federal Marriage Amendment enacted. </s> <s> Another matter on which states differ is crime and punishment. </s> <s> Here, too, they have considerable autonomy. </s> <s> Since the Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that the death penalty was constitutionally permissible, most states have chosen to reinstate it. </s> <s> As a group, however, the 12 states that reject capital punishment have a murder rate that is decidedly lower than those that embrace it. </s> <s> Coincidence?

So, predictably, Congressional leaders delayed facing up to reality. </s> <s> Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary John Snow has been forced to suspend the issuance of United States debt, to postpone indefinitely the announcement of the coming Treasury bill auction and to admit to Congress and the world that he is running out of legal ways to keep America afloat. </s> <s> In other words, with risk and uncertainty emanating from every corner of the global economy, the Congressional leaders@-@ foot-dragging has made them look like fiscal buffoons, courting a loss of lenders@-@ confidence in the government@-@s ability to steward a deeply indebted nation. </s> <s> No one is worried about an American default. </s> <s> But Congress has been playing economic brinksmanship when leadership has been needed and that@-@s foolish. </s> <s> That@-@s not the worst of it. </s> <s> The new fiscal year began Oct. 1, but Congress has failed to pass the spending bills needed to pay for about 20 percent of the federal government virtually everything except defense, homeland security, entitlements like Medicare and interest payments on the national debt. </s> <s> Neither the House nor the Senate was able to stay below the unrealistically low spending caps without resorting to gimmicks, ending up with competing out-of-whack bills that are some @-@8 billion apart. </s> <s> @-@The Senate wants more spending than the relatively more government-averse House. </s> <s> @-@With no time or willingness to bridge their differences, and little appetite for confronting the mess they have created, the lawmakers now plan to lump all the spending into one huge bill: the dreaded omnibus. </s> <s> The great advantage for the faint of heart is that no one will actually see the actual bill before it@-@s passed. </s> <s> The problem is that it will home in on the unrealistic spending targets with an indiscriminate, across-the-board reduction that ignores the real needs the government is supposed to be addressing. </s> <s> For instance, the Energy Department has predicted a 38 percent increase in the cost of home heating oil this winter, but heating assistance for low-income people will probably be cut to allow for an increase of only 5 percent. </s> <s> To make really awful matters worse, members are freely larding the bill with nonessential pork even as they ignore essential needs. </s> <s> There are the usual last-minute anti-environmental riders undermining protections for forests and endangered species, but the worst by far is a proposed @-@2 billion expansion of the lock system on the upper Mississippi River, a project that the National Academy of Sciences has twice reviewed and twice declared a waste of money. </s> <s> Finally, the cost-cutting aspects of this exercise are a fiscal charade. </s> <s> The spending that Congressional Republicans will go after known as nondefense, domestic, discretionary spending is not to blame for the federal budget deficit. </s> <s> Far from being out of control, the growth rate for such spending dropped to a mere 1 percent by 2004, after increasing noticeably in 2002, when surpluses from the Clinton years were thought to still be available. </s> <s> It is highly doubtful that domestic discretionary spending in 2005 will even keep pace with inflation. </s> <s> The real culprits in creating the deficit are the costs of the war and homeland security, and, in particular, the cost of the unnecessary tax cut legislation passed during the Bush presidency, which is 17 times as large as the increases in domestic discretionary spending. </s> <s> Clamping down on domestic spending won@-@t tame the deficit, but it will harm exactly the kinds of government services Americans support and count on. </s> <s> A backlash will

Chris Garcia, a professor of political science at the University of New Mexico. </s> <s> @-@That is a good thing for Hispanics; we@-@re going to be more influential in the future and a bigger target for both campaigns. </s> <s> @-@No one thing explains how Mr. Bush was able to achieve this coup. </s> <s> The loyalty of Cuban-Americans already gave the Republican Party a foothold among Hispanic voters, and Mr. Bush was already strong among Hispanic voters in Texas, who are mainly Mexican-Americans. </s> <s> But the two parties@-@ different strategies, reflected in the Spanish television advertisements, Hispanic scholars and political analysts say, were revealing if not decisive. </s> <s> The Bush campaign approached Hispanic voters exactly the way it did everybody else: by reaching out for cultural conservatives, who in this case just happened to be Hispanic. </s> <s> The Kerry campaign sought votes as if Hispanics, as in the past, were reliably Democrat. </s> <s> The advertisements emphasized issues like immigration and economic opportunity and used few attack advertisement techniques, omnipresent on English-language television, to close the deal. </s> <s> @-@The Democrats made a broad appeal to a Democratic base and not a specific appeal at all to religious Hispanic voters, or even specific segments of the Hispanic electorate,@-@ said Adam Segal, director of the Hispanic Voter Project at the Johns Hopkins University. </s> <s> @-@The Bush campaign used moral values, and specifically the national discussion over gay marriage and abortion rights, as wedge issues within the Hispanic community to try to break off a conservative religious segment. </s> <s> @-@Les Dorrance, a security guard in Denver whose family has lived in Colorado for generations, is the kind of Hispanic voter the Bush campaign went after and won. </s> <s> Mr. Dorrance said conservative values about abortion and the sanctity of marriage were important issues for him, and he went straight down the Republican line after Mr. Bush@-@s name, even going so far as to vote against Ken Salazar, the lone Hispanic on Colorado@-@s statewide ballot, in the process. </s> <s> Mr. Salazar beat the Republican candidate, Pete Coors, for the open Senate seat being vacated by Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Republican who chose not to seek a third term. </s> <s> @-@I voted for Bush based on his moral stance,@-@ Mr. Dorrance said on a recent sunny morning in Denver as he patrolled outside a downtown office building. </s> <s> @-@Bush is pro-life, I@-@m pro-life. </s> <s> He believes marriage should be between a man and a woman, and so do I. </s> <s> @-@But conservative social values were just part of the appeal, experts say. </s> <s> Hispanics are heavily represented in the Marines, for example, and according to some national polls are about as patriotic as Americans get; both factors could have increased support for a sitting president in wartime. </s> <s> And the the candidates@-@s focus on security and global terrorism may have blunted the domestic and economic issues that Democrats have used in the past to score well with the heavily blue-collar Hispanic population. </s> <s> @-@The campaigns, either purposefully or not, didn@-@t bring to the forefront things like jobs, education and health care,@-@ said Janet Murguia, the executive director and chief operating officer of the National Council of La Raza, a nonpartisan civil rights group. </s> <s> @-@At the same time there was a very concerted effort by the Republicans to target the Hispanic community in some new ways.@-@Ms. </s> <s> Murguia said the Roman Catholic Church had a role in that outreach, with sermons and other messages in Spanish-speaking parishes on abortion and embryonic stem cell research, which many conservatives oppose because it can result in destroying human embryos. </s> <s> Negative advertisements by the Bush campaign on Spanish television were also an innovation this year, according to the Hispanic Voter Project at Johns Hopkins. </s> <s> In the 2000 campaign, neither Mr. Bush nor his Democratic opponent, Al Gore, used negative Spanish-language television advertisements, school officials said. </s> <s> Even the tagline that was used in many print advertisements under the president@-@s name reinforced the campaign@-@s message that Mr. Bush was the candidate, despite all the history and tradition with the Democrats, who really spoke the inner language of Hispanic culture. </s> <s> @-@Nos conocemos,@-@ the advertisements said. </s> <s> @-@We know each other. </s> <s> @-@Some political scholars caution that, like Americans in every category, more Hispanic voters cast ballots this year, so it is possible that on-the-ground organization was as responsible as a conservative Republican message. </s> <s> Mr. Bush may have done well, they say, because more of the people who already agreed with him went to the polls. </s> <s> Mr. Bush has personally done well among Hispanic voters before. </s> <s> In his first election for president in 2000, he got 35 percent of the Hispanic vote, second until this year only to Mr. Reagan, who got at least 37 percent in 1984, according to voter surveys going back to 1972. </s> <s> It is too early, some experts say, to suggest that Bush Hispanics will join the ranks of Reagan Democrats. </s> <s> Professor Garcia of the University of New Mexico, for example, does not think that this election portends a permanent new pattern in the Hispanic vote. </s> <s> @-@One swallow does not make a spring,@-@ he said. </s> <s> But other experts say that crossing the 40 percent threshold is a turning point, especially given that the rapidly growing Hispanic population has become the largest ethnic minority in the nation. </s> <s> Mr. Suro, and others, say that perhaps the real message of the election is that Hispanic voters cannot be pigeonholed. </s> <s> In a year when the national Democratic Party floundered in reaching Hispanics, the first two in 30 years were elected to the United States Senate: Mr. Salazar, a Democrat, here in Colorado, and Mel Martinez, a Republican, who was elected to the seat being vacated by Senator Bob Graham in Florida. </s> <s> But where Mr. Salazar is a moderate with deep rural roots as a farmer and rancher, Mr. Martinez is a conservative

and religious experts suggests that a new debate and perhaps a political conversion is taking place in parts of the city@-@s minority neighborhoods, swaths that Democrats have long claimed as their own. </s> <s> It is a conversion that prompted Jeanmarie Salazar, a Puerto Rican mother of four in the Bronx, to vote for President Bush even though his economic policies troubled her. </s> <s> And a conversion that caused Harold Thompson, an African-American from Flatbush who lived through the civil rights movement, to part with a lifetime of voting Democratic, citing the @-@immorality that is destroying our country. </s> <s> @-@Both Ms. Salazar and Mr. Thompson belong to evangelical churches whose leaders have spread a single but potent message: Faith trumps everything else, even traditional party alignments. </s> <s> @-@They@-@re beginning to think about the social transformation of New York City,@-@ said Tony Carnes, a sociologist of religion at Columbia University. </s> <s> Precisely determining the number of people who consider themselves members of evangelical churches or movements is difficult. </s> <s> Mr. Carnes said that he conducted a census of the city@-@s evangelical churches and estimated that 1.5 million New Yorkers attend them. </s> <s> A separate study, conducted in 2000 by the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies, put the

evangelicals in the city is difficult to achieve, it is even harder, at the moment, to define the voting patterns of evangelicals. </s> <s> But the number of Protestant New Yorkers who cast ballots for a Republican president more than doubled in the last four years, to nearly a quarter of those surveyed at polling sites by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International. </s> <s> And a recent study by Mr. Carnes suggested that a majority of evangelical church leaders in the city were breaking with tradition and voting Republican: of 1,006 ordained ministers surveyed last year, Mr. Carnes found, 55 percent said they planned to vote for Mr. Bush. </s> <s> About 30 percent of the ministers were black and 30 percent Hispanic, reflecting the demographic breakdown of the religious group, Mr. Carnes said. </s> <s> @-@It@-@s a significant development,@-@ said Randall Barnes, a professor of American religious history at Barnard College. </s> <s> But, he added, the Republican Party in New York City is @-@still a decade or two away from making significant inroads into that community. </s> <s> @-@Any measuring of the political clout of evangelicals in the city, now or in the future, is complicated by the fact that a sizable portion of them are from other countries, and some are not eligible to vote, said Mr. Carnes, who conducted his study with a team of pollsters at the International Research Institute on Values Changes, an independent research group in New York City. </s> <s> The study was financed by the Christian Cultural Center, a charismatic evangelical church. </s> <s> But the results indicated a shift to the right among voting evangelicals. </s> <s> In a separate study he did in 1997, Mr. Carnes said, only 22 percent of the city@-@s evangelical church leaders surveyed identified themselves as @-@politically conservative. </s> <s> @-@In the aftermath of the election, an increasingly complex image has emerged of the Christian electorate one that is not entirely captured under the religious right rubric. </s> <s> In New York City, there are the evangelicals who consider themselves liberal and voted for Kerry but find that they are missing from the mainstream image of their faith. </s> <s> But then there are those, like Mr. Thompson, who broke with tradition for the first time to vote Republican. </s> <s> And while many New Yorkers have loudly voiced their sense of alienation from the faith-based vote of the red states, the city@-@s evangelicals, in numerous interviews, said they felt a similar invisibility in the Democratic stronghold they call home. </s> <s> @-@You feel like you@-@re alone,@-@ said Abraham Lopez, 19, as he stood on a recent Saturday outside the Assemblies of United Christian Churches on Third Avenue in the South Bronx. </s> <s> Perhaps no single event better captures the group@-@s presence than a same-sex marriage protest on March 14 in the South Bronx. </s> <s> Led by State Senator Rub@-@n Diaz,

Hasen, who teaches election law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, @-@we would be in litigation now. </s> <s> @-@ Mr. Bush won those states by one percentage point; he won Ohio by two. </s> <s> As it turned out, though, Ohio was the crucible. </s> <s> The state relies heavily on punch-card balloting machines of the hanging-chad variety. </s> <s> Voting machines in Ohio failed to register votes for president in 92,000 cases over all this year, a number that includes failure to cast a vote, disallowed double votes and possible counting errors. </s> <s> An electronic voting machine added 3,893 votes to President Bush@-@s tally in a suburban Columbus precinct that has only 800 voters. </s> <s> Officials in Ohio will be able to reject some of the approximately 155,000 provisional ballots cast there, offered to potential voters whose names could not be located on local election rolls, because of the ambiguity of the standards. </s> <s> There were also long lines at the polls, and it is unclear how many people grew too dispirited to keep waiting and ended up not voting. </s> <s> @-@In Ohio,@-@ said Edward B. Foley, who teaches election law at Ohio State University, @-@there is a cloud over the process, even though there is not a cloud over the result. </s> <s> @-@Democratic lawyers concluded that challenges based on these problems could not bridge the 135,000-vote deficit Senator John Kerry faced on Wednesday morning. </s> <s> A recount of the punch cards would have yielded no more than 20,000 votes, election law specialists said, and there was no reason to think that those votes or the provisional ballots would uniformly favor Mr. Kerry. </s> <s> Based on the Ohio experience, election law scholars advocate two types of broad reform: more uniformity within states in registration lists, voting technologies and the distribution of voting machines and replacing partisans with professionals in election administration. </s> <s> @-@Congress has got to try again,@-@ Professor Foley said. </s> <s> @-@We need more money for machines. </s> <s> We need uniform allocation of machines. </s> <s> And Congress has to develop a clearer picture of the process for evaluating provisional ballots. </s> <s> @-@All these issues might have been before the courts if the vote in Ohio had been a little tighter. </s> <s> @-@We had cases ready to be filed,@-@ said Daniel J. Hoffheimer, state counsel to the Kerry campaign in Ohio. </s> <s> @-@If Senator Kerry had decided to really go to the mat on provisional ballots, the Kerry-Edwards legal team would have looked at all the issues out there. </s> <s> @-@Most scholars and lawyers agree the main problems in Ohio resulted from technical failures and inadequate resources rather than partisan bickering in polling places or intentional disenfranchisement. </s> <s> But they said poor and minority voters may have suffered disproportionately. </s> <s> @-@There is a feeling here that the long-line problem was a problem of disparity that fell along socioeconomic lines,@-@ Professor Foley said. </s> <s> @-@There were isolated instances of long lines here in the seven- to nine-hour range, and the common lines were two to three hours. </s> <s> When your line gets to two or three hours, it@-@s system failure. </s> <s> @-@Even if the waits were comparable in poorer and richer precincts, legal scholars said, they might have had a disproportionate impact. </s> <s> If time is money, a long wait is a sort of poll tax, and the rich may be more able to pay it. </s> <s> The lines were in any case baffling, Mr. Hoffheimer said. </s> <s> @-@Although the turnout was not as large as the secretary of state had predicted,@-@ he said, @-@in quite a widespread number of precincts around the state, lines were horrendously long. </s> <s> At one time, one of them was estimated to be 22 hours. </s> <s> @-@On Oct. 29, the Ohio secretary of state, J. Kenneth Blackwell, said he expected 72 percent turnout. </s> <s> His office reported that the actual turnout on Nov. 2 was about 70 percent. </s> <s> Election law scholars say too many decisions about the election process are now made by people who are partisan. </s> <s> Professor Gerken of Harvard took exception to the actions of Mr. Blackwell, a Republican. </s> <s> @-@He was making judgment calls that were simply implausible,@-@ she said, citing a decision, later rescinded, that registration forms on anything less than 80-pound paper stock should be rejected. </s> <s> Legal scholars agreed that changes to the system must be made behind what philosophers call the veil of ignorance without knowing how the change will affect particular outcomes. </s> <s> For this reason, it is unclear whether the Colorado initiative that would have allocated the state@-@s electoral votes proportionately was defeated on its merits or because it could have immediately changed the outcome of the election. </s> <s> Bush voters confident of victory in the state may have voted against the measure to ensure that their candidate received all nine of the state@-@s electoral votes. </s> <s> For similar reasons, scholars say that if litigation is needed to clarify election procedures, it should be brought before an election. </s> <s> The election left many questions unanswered about its most significant innovation: provisional ballots, required by a 2002 federal law intended to restore public confidence after the grueling Florida recount. </s> <s> County election officials in Ohio are now determining whether those ballots should be counted. </s> <s> That will take some time, and the process has critics. </s> <s> In Ohio, for instance, four-member county election boards, each with two Republicans and two Democrats, will decide, with the approval of three members needed to count the votes. </s> <s> @-@Party officials should not be deciding who can vote,@-@ Professor Gerken said. </s> <s> EditorialIn a rare gesture of transparency, a majority of the eight commissioners on the United States Commission on Civil Rights voted in 2002 to put the agency@-@s staff reports on the Internet as soon as they are completed. </s> <s> That way, the public can read them before the commissioners hold public hearings to discuss the staff@-@s findings. </s> <s> The latest report an assessment of President Bush@-@s civil rights record was put on the agency@-@s Web site in September. </s> <s> But at their October meeting, less than a month before the election, the commissioners declined to discuss it. </s> <s> Objecting to the report@-@s timing, the four commissioners appointed by President Bush and the Congressional Republican leadership managed to put off any discussion until the postelection meeting, scheduled for today. </s> <s> The commission owes the public a spirited debate, especially if, as the report indicates, the apparent aim of the Bush administration is to break with long-established civil rights tactics and priorities. </s> <s> This question takes on a new urgency with the appointment of the White House counsel, Alberto Gonzales, as the next attorney general because he was deeply involved in the formulation of administration policy on these issues in the first term. </s> <s> The report, which is still available online, is a scathing 166-page assessment of an administration that has, at best, neglected core civil rights issues. </s> <s> It cites numerous examples of administration attempts to replace affirmative action with @-@race neutral@-@ alternatives, to focus on voter fraud rather than the more insidious problem of voter disenfranchisement and to recast taxpayers@-@ support for religious institutions as a civil right for people of faith, rather than as a constitutional issue involving the separation of church and state. </s> <s> In the most telling research into the way that Mr. Bush uses talk of civil rights to promote his own agenda, the report says that of Mr. Bush@-@s public statements on civil rights, only 17 percent have outlined plans of action. </s> <s> Of those, it says, more than half pertained to @-@faith-based initiatives. </s> <s> @-@ It criticizes the president for using the language of civil rights terms like @-@remove barriers@-@ and @-@equal access@-@ to frame his case. </s> <s> Earlier this year, the conservative commissioners simply voted down, without explanation, a staff report on language barriers in federal programs. </s> <s> Such disdain for the very issues the commissioners are supposed to examine deprives Americans of the dialogue they need and deserve. </s> <s> It is our hope that the conservative commissioners will engage with the issues and their fellow commissioners at today@-@s meeting. </s> <s> In any case, Americans can judge the civil rights report for themselves by going to www.usccr.gov. </s> <s> THE 2004 ELECTIONS: THE ELECTORATE THE VOTERSBy Katharine Q.

would not give him enough votes to change that result. </s> <s> Experts in computer security have found flaws in the software and physical design of new touch-screen voting machines from every major

defensive effort to avoid mistakes they made four years ago, the Bush campaign concentrated on the new face of Florida, winning a margin of nearly 20,000 votes in Pasco and racking up many thousands more in counties like it. </s> <s> As early returns came in on election night, the president@-@s strong showing here prompted Governor Bush to call his brother in the White House with the news. </s> <s> @-@This was much better than what our projections were for a narrow victory,@-@ the governor said he told President Bush. </s> <s> @-@You are going to win. </s> <s> @-@What happened in Pasco

held rallies in out-of-the-way places like Gainesville, Niceville, New Port Richey and the Villages, a giant subdivision in Central Florida, while not neglecting conservative cities like Pensacola and even making several stops in Palm Beach County, a Democratic stronghold. </s> <s> But it was aggressive grass-roots efforts in new population centers like Pasco that Republicans say turned out record numbers of Bush supporters on Election Day, expanding a 537-vote margin four years ago to nearly 400,000 votes this year. </s> <s> In particular, the Republicans focused these efforts on conservatives who had often failed to vote. </s> <s> The Republicans enlisted 109,000 volunteers statewide to make a total of three million voter contacts on Election Day and the five days prior, strategists said.

Democratic strategists who had orchestrated their own intensive turnout drive here and expected the result to be as close this time. </s> <s> @-@We woke up the beast,@-@ said Mitchell Berger, a Fort Lauderdale lawyer who led the Democratic Party@-@s effort to mobilize lawyers to monitor the polls. </s> <s> For example, in the Interstate 4 corridor that runs from Tampa through Orlando and up to Daytona Beach, the Republican National Committee had set a goal in early 2003 of attracting 10,000 volunteers, a target that Republicans in the state saw as ambitious and optimistic. </s> <s> And yet on Election Day, they were surprised to see that more than 25,000 in that region had volunteered to help Mr. Bush win re-election. </s> <s> Three of the four hurricanes that battered Florida this year swept through the I-4 corridor, and the fourth hit the Panhandle. </s> <s> Mr. Bush visited after every storm and swiftly sent federal aid to the regions, a potential factor in his success there. </s> <s> Nothing, though, was more crucial to the president@-@s triumph than the Republicans@-@ decision to identify and lobby what some of them called @-@unreliable@-@ or @-@lazy@-@ voters, a group of about 1.5 million people who were seen as unmotivated because they had participated in only one of the last three or four elections, or were newly registered to vote. </s> <s> In the weeks before Election Day, Republican volunteers, including dozens in Pasco County, repeatedly contacted people in this group. </s> <s> @-@If you fell in that universe and were a Republican or a likely Republican

last spring to determine what issues resounded with Pasco County residents, and courted them with events like a Fourth of July barbecue that he said drew several thousand people. </s> <s> In Dade

P. Morgan Private Bank. </s> <s> Scott Gewirtz, co-head of government bond trading at Deutsche Bank, said that investors would be reminded of the worry over economic growth as soon as tomorrow, when the government is expected to release the employment report for October. </s> <s> The forecast of 175,000 new jobs is better than the average for the year but not robust. </s> <s> In addition, Federal Reserve policy makers meet Tuesday and are expected, as long as the jobs data is not unexpectedly weak, to raise their benchmark short-term interest rate a quarter-point, to 2 percent the fourth rate increase since June. </s> <s> Besides the economy and the Fed, investors will have to factor in the outlook for the record federal budget deficit, which could become a drag on the bond market if Mr. Bush cannot begin to reduce it, as he promised during the campaign. </s> <s> The sobering fact for investors is that despite the benign outlook for the economy all year, the stock market has been stuck in a trading range since February. </s> <s> Even with yesterday@-@s gains, the Dow is down 3 percent for the year while the Nasdaq is up 0.05 percent, and the S.@-@P. 500 stock index has climbed 2.8 percent. </s> <s> And all three gauges are below their highs for the year. </s> <s> The dollar fell against the euro and slipped against the yen yesterday. </s> <s> Because of the size of the federal budget deficit and the record current account deficit, which measures the balance of the country@-@s trade in goods and services with the rest of the world, some analysts had predicted that the dollar would begin a long-term decline no matter who was elected president. </s> <s> The price of crude oil, after spending one day below @-@50 a barrel, jumped 2.5 percent, to @-@50.88. </s> <s> While investors seemed certain of the election outcome yesterday, on Tuesday they appeared to be misled by the exit polls that quickly began to circulate on Web sites. </s> <s> The early exit polls, which put Mr. Kerry in the lead nationally and in crucial states, led to a sell-off in the afternoon that wiped out almost all of Tuesday@-@s early gains. </s> <s> The stock market response yesterday to the Bush victory was easily seen in one of the market sectors that analysts said the president would favor, drug makers. </s> <s> The stock of Merck jumped 4 percent, while Pfizer climbed 2.6 percent. </s> <s> But the main sense yesterday morning was one of relief that election results would not be drawn out for days, if not weeks, as in 2000. </s> <s> That relief buoyed stocks, which had been trading sluggishly for months, and prompted selling in the bond market, where many investors had moved in anticipation of a drawn-out post-election drama. </s> <s> @-@It@-@s just that the certainty of the outcome came so quickly,@-@ said Ernie Ankrim, chief investment strategist at the Russell Investment Group. </s> <s> By the close of the stock market, the three market gauges had

from 4.05 on Tuesday, while the price, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, slipped 8@-@32, to 101 11@-@32. </s> <s> Overnight, the 10-year yield shot up to almost 4.20 percent, traders said. </s> <s> Mr. Gewirtz of Deutsche Bank said that one reason that Treasury yields were still so low, despite the Fed@-@s rate increases, is that investors expect policy makers to move slowly in raising rates. </s> <s> In addition, the sharp rise in the price of crude oil is expected to restrain growth some, while not being too inflationary. </s> <s> As for the budget deficit, which was @-@413 billion in the year ended Sept. 30, Mr. Gewirtz said it should be a factor in investors@-@ minds. </s> <s> @-@The general view of Bush,@-@ he said, @-@is that he doesn@-@t worry about deficits. </s> <s> @-@But he added, right now @-@the market is saying that the Fed and the economy are more important than the deficit. </s> <s> @-@In the foreign exchange market, the euro rose to @-@1.2821, from @-@1.2674 Tuesday. </s> <s> The euro@-@s 2004 high, of @-@1.2926, was set in February. </s> <s> The dollar was at 106.15 yen, down 0.2 percent from 106.39 Tuesday. </s> <s> David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, said that a Bush victory was seen as better for the dollar than a Kerry victory because Mr. Bush was regarded as more likely to favor business, the stock market and free trade. </s> <s> But Mr. Gilmore added that if neither the federal budget deficit nor the current account deficit begin to shrink, foreign investors will be less willing to invest here. </s> <s> And if foreign inflows slow, the value of the dollar will fall and interest rates will rise. </s> <s> THE 2004 ELECTION: HOLLYWOODBy Sharon Waxman and Randy KennedyDisappointment was

</s> <s> Online fund-raising spread quickly, allowing candidates, parties and advocacy groups a low-cost supplement to big-donor fund-raising. </s> <s> The Internet pioneer MoveOn.org, which advocated

S. soldiers and Iraqi security forces. </s> <s> Civil strife between Shiites and Sunnis has escalated. </s> <s> The jihadist wing of the insurgency has made civilians into primary targets, which in turn has encouraged Shiite militias, working closely with the government, to use outrageous tactics including torture and targeted assassination in the fight against those insurgents. </s> <s> Meanwhile, ordinary Iraqis, acting as if they expect a civil war, are moving out of mixed towns to safer, more homogeneous communities. </s> <s> You can hardly blame them, seeing that the United States has not managed to provide security and that denominational tensions have continued to mount. </s> <s> The deteriorating security situation, coupled with rising opposition to the war in the United States, has fueled the view that the game is up. </s> <s> Yet there has also been significant progress toward Sunni participation in the political process. </s> <s> Before the elections last January, no one in the world @-@outside the senior levels of the Bush administration@-@ expected Sunnis to turn out in more than token numbers. </s> <s> Since the constitutional referendum in October, though, several Sunni political parties have formed to contest this week@-@s elections. </s> <s> These parties may soon represent the first organized, credible voice for Sunnis in the new Iraq. </s> <s> They can be expected to seek their fair share of the political spoils in the new Parliament but to get them, they will have to offer something, beginning with a drawing down of violence on the part of the ex-Baathist, ex-military wing of the insurgency. </s> <s> In return, they may obtain a reduced role for the de-Baathification commission so unpopular with their constituents and perhaps some flexibility from Shiite leaders on the degree of autonomy to be sought by the oil-rich south. </s> <s> Of course, even if the insurgency diminishes, jihadist terror will remain. </s> <s> But lest we forget, societies can survive protracted terrorist violence against civilian targets. </s> <s> Israel has been living with such attacks for decades. </s> <s> Tragic, costly and debilitating, terrorism nonetheless can coexist with ordinary politics and ordinary lives. </s> <s> It is an uncomfortable truth that American forces in Iraq have come to provide a motivation for terrorist violence. </s> <s> It is equally uncomfortable to acknowledge that with each day that it cannot defeat the insurgency, the United States loses credibility as a military power able to achieve its objectives through force. </s> <s> In the near term, however, if the Iraqis are to reach a political agreement that holds, they cannot do it without U. S. troops as guarantors of any pact. </s> <s> For all their complaints about occupation, the new Sunni politicians understand this. </s> <s> Instead of calling for immediate withdrawal, they are urging a timetable for a phased pullout a request to which Shiite and Kurdish leaders are ready to acquiesce. </s> <s> The willingness of Iraqi leaders to reach such a consensus suggests that, for them at least, the construction of a functioning postwar Iraqi state is not yet out of the question. </s> <s> This latest effort at pact-making could well fail. </s> <s> Elected Sunnis could prove unable to deliver a reduction in insurgent violence, and the civil war could go into high gear. </s> <s> Lebanon-in-Vietnam a rough approximation of the horror that would follow really would mark a defeat for the United States, one that would leave many thousands dead and probably could not be cabined within the borders of Iraq. </s> <s> Unbearably enough, such a catastrophe would look like the kind of situation that often leads humanitarians in the United States to call for intervention. </s> <s> But it is indefensible to claim that this disastrous outcome is inevitable and ethically obtuse to use such a prediction to justify doing nothing to prevent it. </s> <s> All is not well in Iraq. </s> <s> But all is not lost, either. </s> <s> THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 12-11-05: ESSAY Noah Feldman is a contributing writer for the magazine and a law professor at New York University. </s> <s> He was a senior adviser to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq. </s> <s> EditorialSearching for their lost mojo, Democratic Party leaders are preparing to fiddle with the presidential nomination calendar in an effort to tap into greater voter diversity and avoid an early rush to judgment that can wear thin with voters. </s> <s> Good idea but a special 40-member study commission is reported to be set on far too much of a minimalist approach. </s> <s> It is expected to recommend that two to four states be inserted between Iowa@-@s traditional opening caucuses and New Hampshire@-@s first-in-the-nation primary. </s> <s> These additions would include more of a voice for groups like blacks and Hispanics, industrial workers and Southerners, who are obviously neglected in the Iowa and New Hampshire battlegrounds. </s> <s> There, the candidate is too often settled in a hysterical contest in winter snows while other Americans can only watch like couch potatoes. </s> <s> New Hampshire Democrats are already miffed that they would have to wait two weeks, not one, after Iowa@-@s caucuses, even though they would still hold the first voting primary; the additional states would all run less-binding caucuses. </s> <s> But a co-chairman of the study panel, Representative David Price of North Carolina, is absolutely correct in saying that @-@there needs to be a more diverse set of early contests. </s> <s> @-@ Even so, Democrats should be mindful that doing the wrong thing can be worse than doing nothing. </s> <s> Adding three or four different caucus results in 2008 may just wind up increasing New Hampshire@-@s clout and do nothing to avoid the current problem of having one small state settle too much too soon, before all the issues and options are examined. </s> <s> There is another way: four regional groups of state primaries could be spaced at a more thoughtful pace. </s> <s> This was the recommendation earlier this year of a bipartisan panel examining the problems of nonparticipation in elections. </s> <s> The regions could rotate going first to avoid some new set of sanctimonious claims to an inviolate historic privilege. </s> <s> The Democrats will present their proposal on Saturday and are aiming to lock in a calendar by next spring. </s> <s> Since nothing@-@s set yet in stone or snow, there@-@s still time for the Democrats to dare to be as inclusive as possible. </s> <s> Op-Ed ColumnistBy Maureen DowdOur secretary of state@-@s tortuous defense of supposedly nonexistent C.

Connecticut, a 1965 decision that established a married couple@-@s right to use contraception and later served as a basis for Roe. </s> <s> Mr. Brownback said Ms. Miers did not use the term @-@settled law@-@ to describe Roe a phrase that, he said, would have been @-@a red flag@-@ indicating she would not overturn the decision. </s> <s> But neither would she discuss it, saying related cases could come before the court. </s> <s> @-@She has stated that she does not believe the circumstances of Griswold will come back in front of the court,@-@ Mr. Brownback said, recounting the conversation, @-@but that the legal issue of Roe, clearly, and the legal issue involved here is very much a live issue. </s> <s> @-@A White House spokeswoman, Dana Perino, later said that Ms. Miers had simply acknowledged that @-@abortion and Roe-related issues are ones that are live before the court. </s> <s> @-@While other Republican senators have emerged from their meetings with Ms. Miers offering more effusive praise of her than before, Senator Brownback said his view was unchanged. </s> <s> He complained that he was left trying @-@to gather little pieces of shreds of evidence@-@ about her views not only on abortion but on other matters of importance to social conservatives, including gay marriage and the role of religion in public life. </s> <s> The Kansas senator is important for two reasons. </s> <s> First, he is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and it would be an embarrassment to President Bush if a Republican on the panel voted against Ms. Miers. </s> <s> Second, Mr. Brownback, a possible presidential candidate in 2008, is considered a leading voice for conservatives in the Senate. </s> <s> Should he vote against Ms. Miers, other Republicans contemplating White House bids could feel compelled to follow. </s> <s> Ms. Miers, the White House counsel and former president of the State Bar of Texas, has been assiduously courting senators since Monday, when President Bush announced that he had picked her to fill the seat being vacated by Justice Sandra Day O@-@Connor, a critical swing vote. </s> <s> But the selection has drawn intense criticism from both ends of the political spectrum, with the left labeling Ms. Miers a crony and the right complaining that Mr. Bush has squandered a chance to pick a candidate with demonstrable conservative credentials. </s> <s> On Thursday, some conservative senators tried to push back. </s> <s> Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, denounced what he called a smear campaign by conservatives and said Ms. Miers@-@s critics should @-@just shut up for a few minutes@-@ to let her make her case. </s> <s> Mr. Graham said Ms. Miers did not seem troubled by the attacks. </s> <s> But in a speech earlier this year before the Republican National Lawyers Association, Ms. Miers said she was deeply troubled by the treatment received by another judicial nominee and fellow Texan, Priscilla Owen. </s> <s> Judge Owen, whose confirmation had been blocked by Democrats, was ultimately confirmed as an appeals court judge. </s> <s> @-@I read with disbelief the horrific press and the efforts to diminish the character, the intelligence, the service of this very fine person,@-@ Ms. Miers said in the April 22 speech. </s> <s> @-@It@-@s a tragedy what@-@s happened to this fine woman,@-@ Ms. Miers concluded. </s> <s> @-@It@-@s a tragedy what has happened to this fine judge. </s> <s> @-@Aside from Mr. Brownback, Ms. Miers seems to be assuaging the concerns of some Republican senators. </s> <s> Mr. Graham said Thursday he was @-@very predisposed to support her,@-@ although he did say she would have to @-@create a comfort level@-@ among conservatives and persuade the public @-@that she@-@s qualified, that her life experiences, the sum total of them, make her capable of having this job. </s> <s> @-@As of Thursday, Ms. Miers had met with 15 senators, only three of them Democrats. </s> <s> One of the Democrats, Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois, the number two Democrat in the Senate, said that when he asked her about decisions of the Bush administration, Ms. Miers said she was not sure if she could comment on her role. </s> <s> And he said that, unlike the most recent nominee, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who spent his legal career arguing cases before the Supreme Court, Ms. Miers was not yet ready to discuss many substantive constitutional or policy issues. </s> <s> Mr. Durbin said the heavy criticism from conservatives was putting Ms. Miers in an impossible position. </s> <s> @-@If she successfully satisfies the far right, where does that leave the rest of America? </s> <s> @-@ Mr. Durbin said. </s> <s> @-@I can@-@t see the endgame. </s> <s> I can@-@t see how it ends. </s> <s> @-@Neither could Senator Brownback, who did not say whether he believed Ms. Miers would be confirmed. </s> <s> Although Chief Justice Roberts took essentially the same position as Ms. Miers in discussing Griswold and Roe, and Mr. Brownback voted for him, the senator has said consistently that he wanted the nominee for the O@-@Connor seat to have @-@a clear track record. </s> <s> @-@Asked to compare the two, Mr. Brownback described the chief justice as @-@a rock star of a lawyer. </s> <s> @-@ Of Ms. Miers, he said, @-@You@-@re really following Elvis here. </s> <s> @-@STORM AND CRISIS: DEMOCRATSBy Adam Nagourney and Carl HulseCorrection AppendedWASHINGTON, Sept. 7 - After 10 days of often uncertain responses to the Bush administration@-@s management of Hurricane Katrina, Democratic leaders unleashed a burst of attacks on the White House on Wednesday, saying the wreckage in New Orleans raised doubts about the country@-@s readiness to endure a terrorist attack and exposed ominous economic rifts that they said had worsened under five years of Republican rule. </s> <s> From Democratic leaders on the floor of Congress, to a speech by the Democratic National Committee chairman at a meeting of the National Baptist Convention in Miami, to four morning television interviews by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrats offered what was shaping up as the most concerted attack that they had mounted on the White House in the five years of the Bush presidency.@-@Oblivious. </s> <s> In denial. </s> <s> Dangerous,@-@ Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and the House minority leader, said of President Bush as she stood in front of a battery of uniformed police officers and firefighters in a Capitol Hill ceremony that had originally been scheduled to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. </s> <s> @-@Americans should now harbor no illusions about the government@-@s ability to respond effectively to disasters,@-@ she said. </s> <s> @-@Our vulnerabilities were laid bare. </s> <s> @-@Former Senator John Edwards, a likely candidate for president in 2008 and the Democratic Party@-@s vice-presidential nominee in 2004, argued that the breakdown in New Orleans illustrated the central theme of his national campaigns: the nation has been severed into two Americas. </s> <s> @-@The truth is the people who suffer the most from Katrina are the very people who suffer the most every day,@-@ Mr. Edwards said in a speech in North Carolina on Wednesday, according to a transcript provided by his office. </s> <s> And Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004, said in an interview: @-@It@-@s a summary of all that this administration is not in touch with and has faked and ducked and bobbed over the past four years. </s> <s> What you see here is a harvest of four years of complete avoidance of real problem solving and real governance in favor of spin and ideology. </s> <s> @-@The display of unity was striking for a party that has been adrift since Mr. Kerry@-@s defeat, struggling to reach consensus on issues like the war in Iraq and the Supreme Court nomination of Judge John G.

Two e-mails sent by a reporter carried incorrect addresses. </s> <s> Mr. McClellan therefore was unable to respond; he did not fail to do so. </s> <s> EditorialMost of us think of America@-@s national parks as everlasting places, parts of the bedrock of how we know our own country. </s> <s> But they are shaped and protected by an underlying body of legislation, which is distilled into a basic policy document that governs their operation. </s> <s> Over time, that document has slowly evolved, but it has always stayed true to the fundamental principle of leaving the parks unimpaired for future generations. </s> <s> That has meant, in part, sacrificing some of the ways we might use the parks today in order to protect them for tomorrow. </s> <s> Recently, a secret draft revision of the national park system@-@s basic management policy document has been circulating within the Interior Department. </s> <s> It was prepared, without consultation within the National Park Service, by Paul Hoffman, a deputy assistant secretary at Interior who once ran the Chamber of Commerce in Cody, Wyo., was a Congressional aide to Dick Cheney and has no park service experience. </s> <s> Within national park circles, this rewrite of park rules has been met with profound dismay, for it essentially undermines the protected status of the national parks. </s> <s> The document makes it perfectly clear that this rewrite was not prompted by a compelling change in the park system@-@s circumstances. </s> <s> It was prompted by a change in political circumstances the opportunity to craft a vision of the national parks that suits the Bush administration. </s> <s> Some of Mr. Hoffman@-@s changes are trivial, although even apparently subtle changes in wording from @-@protect@-@ to @-@conserve,@-@ for instance soften the standard used to judge the environmental effects of park policy. </s> <s> But there is nothing subtle about the main thrust of this rewrite. </s> <s> It is a frontal attack on the idea of @-@impairment. </s> <s> @-@ According to the act that established the national parks, preventing impairment of park resources including the landscape, wildlife and such intangibles as the soundscape of Yellowstone, for instance is the @-@fundamental purpose. </s> <s> @-@ In Mr. Hoffman@-@s world, it is now merely one of the purposes. </s> <s> Mr. Hoffman@-@s rewrite would open up nearly every park in the nation to off-road vehicles, snowmobiles and Jet Skis. </s> <s> According to his revision, the use of such vehicles would become one of the parks@-@ purposes. </s> <s> To accommodate such activities, he redefines impairment to mean an irreversible impact. </s> <s> To prove that an activity is impairing the parks, under Mr. Hoffman@-@s rules, you would have to prove that it is doing so irreversibly a very high standard of proof. </s> <s> This would have a genuinely erosive effect on the standards used to protect the national parks. </s> <s> The pattern prevails throughout this 194-page document easing the rules that limit how visitors use the parks and toughening the standard of proof needed to block those uses. </s> <s> Behind this pattern, too, there is a fundamental shift in how the parks are regarded. </s> <s> If the laws establishing the national park system were fundamentally forward-looking if their mission, first and foremost, was protecting the parks for the future Mr. Hoffman@-@s revisions place a new, unwelcome and unnecessary emphasis on the present, on what he calls @-@opportunities for visitors to use and enjoy their parks. </s> <s> @-@There is no question that we go to national parks to use and enjoy them. </s> <s> But part of the enjoyment of being in a place like Yosemite or the Grand Canyon is knowing that no matter how much it changes in the natural processes of time, it will continue to exist substantially unchanged. </s> <s> There are other issues too. </s> <s> Mr. Hoffman would explicitly allow the sale of religious merchandise, and he removes from the policy document any reference to evolution or evolutionary processes. </s> <s> He does everything possible to strip away a scientific basis for park management. </s> <s> His rules would essentially require park superintendents to subordinate the management of their parks to local and state agendas. </s> <s> He also envisions a much wider range of commercial activity within the parks. </s> <s> In short, this is not a policy for protecting the parks. </s> <s> It is a policy for destroying them. </s> <s> The Interior Department has already begun to distance itself from this rewrite, which it kept hidden from park service employees. </s> <s> But what Mr. Hoffman has given us is a road map of what could happen to the parks if Mr. Bush@-@s political appointees are allowed to have their way. </s> <s> It is clear by now that Mr. Bush has no real intention of living up to his campaign promise to fully finance the national parks. </s> <s> This document offers a vivid picture of the divide between the National Park Service, whose career employees remain committed to the fundamental purpose of leaving the parks unimpaired, and an Interior Department whose political appointees seem willing to alter them beyond recognition, partly in the service of commercial objectives. </s> <s> Suddenly, many things like the administration@-@s efforts

@-@There@-@s a view among House members and the leadership staff that the White House feels it has to deal with us to move legislation, but that otherwise we don@-@t exist to them,@-@ said a senior

now that they have left behind the politics of the 1990@-@s, when she was a symbol of the liberal excesses of the Clinton White House and he was a fiery spokesman for a resurgent conservative movement in Washington. </s> <s> Beyond the issue of health care, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Gingrich have forged a relatively close relationship working on a panel the Pentagon created to come up with ways to improve the nation@-@s military readiness, according to people close to them. </s> <s> Mr. Gingrich says he has been struck by how pro-defense Mrs. Clinton has turned out to be at a time when other

an area of mutual concern: the need to spur greater online exchanges of medical information among patients, doctors, health insurers and other medical experts. </s> <s> That, in turn, led to the press conference that both attended this week. </s> <s> For all the headlines this unlikely duo is grabbing now, the thaw in their relationship dates back at least to December 2003, when Mr. Gingrich showed

<s> They finance conservative research centers like the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute and the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, entities that make up the second level of the pyramid. </s> <s> The ideas these organizations develop are then pushed up to the third level of the pyramid the political level. </s> <s> There, strategists like Karl Rove or Ralph Reed or Ken Mehlman take these new ideas and, through polling, focus groups and careful attention to Democratic attacks, convert them into language that will appeal to the broadest electorate. </s> <s> That language is sometimes in the form of an assault on Democrats and at other times in the form of advocacy for a new policy position. </s> <s> The development process can take years. </s> <s> And then there@-@s the fourth level of the pyramid: the partisan news media. </s> <s> Conservative commentators and networks spread these finely honed ideas. </s> <s> At the very top of the pyramid you@-@ll find the president. </s> <s> Because the pyramid is stable, all you have to do is put a different top on it and it works fine. </s> <s> It is not quite the @-@right wing conspiracy@-@ that Hillary Clinton described, but it is an

<s> They know their roles and execute them because they@-@re paid well and believe, I think, in what they@-@re saying. </s> <s> True, there@-@s lots of money involved, but the money makes a difference because it goes toward reinforcing a structure that is already stable. </s> <s> To understand how the Democratic Party works, invert the pyramid. </s> <s> Imagine a pyramid balancing precariously on

M. R. I., to scan the brains of 10 Republicans and 10 Democrats, producing images like those seen above. </s> <s> We measured brain activity while subjects looked at political advertisements and at images of the presidential candidates. </s> <s> The news media have focused on our finding that the amygdala, a part of the brain that responds to danger, was more heightened in Democrats when viewing scenes of 9@-@11 than in Republicans. </s> <s> This might seem to indicate fundamental differences, but other aspects of our results suggest striking commonalities. </s> <s> While viewing their own candidate, both Democrats and Republicans showed activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, an area associated with strong instinctive feelings of emotional connection. </s> <s> Viewing the opposing candidate, however, activated the anterior cingulate cortex, which indicates cognitive and emotional conflict. </s> <s> It also lighted up the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, an area that acts to suppress or shape emotional reactions. </s> <s> These patterns of brain activity, made visible on the f. M. R. </s> <s> I. </s> <s> @-@s, suggest that both Bush and Kerry voters were mentally battling their attraction to the other side. </s> <s> Bush voters wanted to follow Mr. Kerry; Kerry voters found appeal in Mr. Bush. </s> <s> Both groups fought this instinct by arguing to themselves that their impulses were wrong. </s> <s> By recalling flaws associated with the opposition, the voters displaced attraction with dislike. </s> <s> Because the process happened nearly instantaneously, only the final sense of dismay reached full awareness. </s> <s> Simplifying the neurophysiology somewhat, one can regard the process of reaching an opinion or making a choice as a collaboration between two regions of the brain the limbic area, which feels emotions, and the prefrontal cortex, which controls the processing of ideas and information. </s> <s> The two areas work in tandem: thoughts provoke feelings, and in turn, the intensity of these feelings determines how the thoughts are valued. </s> <s> In reacting to pictures of the opposing candidate, the voters we tested countered the feelings of connection with even stronger hostile emotions, which they induced by calling up negative images and ideas. </s> <s> This dance between strong emotions and interconnected ideas is well known in psychiatry, and it forms the foundation of cognitive behavioral therapy, an effective form of talk therapy. </s> <s> When there is a divorce, for example, adolescents may induce in themselves feelings of rage toward one parent out of loyalty to the other. </s> <s> A cognitive behavioral therapist could help quench this rage by challenging the child@-@s beliefs about the estranged parent. </s> <s> Without the beliefs to sustain it, the rage disappears. </s> <s> In the case of this past election, while we witnessed an electorate that seemed irreconcilably divided, using f. M. R. I., we could see that the Republicans and Democrats we tested liked both candidates. </s> <s> The initial reflex toward allegiance is easy to explain: people rise through the ranks to run for higher office because they are able to evoke in others a powerful impulse to join their cause. </s> <s> Voters sense this attraction, and to keep from succumbing, they dredge up emotion-laden negative images as a counterweight. </s> <s> This suggests that the passions swirling through elections are not driven by a deep commitment to issues. </s> <s> We are not fighting over the future of the country; we are fighting for our team, like Red Sox and Yankee fans arguing over which club has the better catcher. </s> <s> Both in an election and in baseball, all that really matters is who wears the team uniform. </s> <s> Will an awareness that we are conning ourselves to feel alienated from each other help to close the political gap? </s> <s> It is unknown, because neuroscience has advanced only recently to the point where humans can begin to watch themselves think and feel. </s> <s> If we are going to solve the nation@-@s complicated problems, it is important to close this gap because in a setting where emotions run high, careful thoughts have no chance against intoxicating ones. </s> <s> In divisive politics, as in highly spiced dishes, all subtlety is lost. </s> <s> So, Democrats, admit that you admire the confidence and decisiveness of President Bush. </s> <s> And Republicans, concede that you would like a president to have the depth of knowledge and broad intelligence of Mr. Kerry. </s> <s> Now that f.

Duberstein, a Republican lobbyist who was the White House chief of staff under President Ronald Reagan and is now part of Mr. Rove@-@s vast network of informal advisers and intelligence gatherers. </s> <s> Under one of his hats, Mr. Rove is running a sophisticated campaign on behalf of the president@-@s Social Security proposals, employing all the components of the national political machine built to re-elect Mr. Bush. </s> <s> Under the other, he is overseeing policy meetings where the administration@-@s senior officials analyze the competing Social Security proposals, bone up on arcane economic concepts and plot how to hit back at the substantive arguments made by people on the other side of the issue. </s> <s> Other presidents have had powerful advisers with a hand in both politics and policy. </s> <s> The most-cited model in recent times is James A. Baker III, who had a wide-ranging portfolio in the administrations of Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush@-@s father, and went from political operative to treasury secretary, to secretary of state, then back to overseeing a presidential campaign. </s> <s> But the intensity of Mr. Rove@-@s involvement in politics and policy makes his current status unusual and gives him remarkably broad authority inside the White House and out. </s> <s> And in giving Mr. Rove his new title, Mr. Bush, freed from the need to think about re-election, seemed to acknowledge what everyone in Washington knows: that in this administration, as in all others, politics and policy are inextricably intertwined. </s> <s> @-@Karl Rove is the crossing guard at the intersection of policy and politics,@-@ said Marshall Wittmann, a senior fellow at the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, who previously observed Mr. Rove for years as an aide to Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, and as legislative director of the Christian Coalition. </s> <s> @-@He blends political hack and propeller head in a way no one has ever achieved,@-@ Mr. Wittmann said. </s> <s> @-@No one is going to question his political expertise or his policy expertise. </s> <s> The question for him is always one of hubris. </s> <s> @-@The most concrete change stemming from Mr. Rove@-@s additional title may be that he has moved to a prime piece of real estate on the first floor, down the hall from the Oval Office, from a small office on the second floor of the West Wing. </s> <s> Beyond that, at least as administration officials tell it, nothing fundamental has changed in his power or his role, and his additional title does not portend a more aggressive melding of political and policy concerns. </s> <s> Mr. Rove declined to be quoted for this article. </s> <s> To outsiders, it is hard to know exactly what to make of Mr. Rove@-@s new role as one of two deputy chiefs of staff @-@the other, Joe Hagin, is little known outside the White House but is also close to Mr. Bush@-@. </s> <s> After years at Mr. Bush@-@s side they met in the 1970@-@s and have worked together closely since before Mr. Bush first ran for governor of Texas in 1994 Mr. Rove does not really need a new title to convey his power, especially after guiding the president to a convincing re-election last year. </s> <s> In retaining his title as senior adviser, he in any case has a job broadly defined enough to weigh in on big decisions whenever he wants. </s> <s> But on the organization chart, the new post leaves him or the half of him that is purely policy beneath Andrew H.

Ryan of Wisconsin and Senator John E. Sununu of New Hampshire. </s> <s> And there is grumbling among some Republicans that Mr. Rove has mishandled the Social Security campaign. </s> <s> But Mr. Rove@-@s allies and fans say that he anticipated the difficulties of moving the Social Security debate forward and that he and Mr. Bush remain convinced that they will win in the end. </s> <s> @-@Anyone who thinks otherwise,@-@ said Charlie Black, a veteran Republican strategist, @-@they@-@re underestimating Karl and they@-@re underestimating the president. </s> <s> @-@EditorialAs the Democrats@-@ newly chosen party chairman, Howard Dean has a fresh opportunity to be remembered as someone other than that presidential candidate who yelped defiantly in the face of defeat. </s> <s> The Democrats@-@ fortunes are obviously at a low point. </s> <s> But Mr. Dean, in his surprising victory in the contest for chairman, showed a revivalist@-@s energy and a new talent for working across the political spectrum in winning over state party leaders. </s> <s> Mr. Dean@-@s task is to build concretely on that base while disappointing Republican expectations that he will prove to be a radioactive chairman, given to upstaging his party@-@s candidates with fresh variations on The Scream. </s> <s> To calm doubters, Mr. Dean talks more as the party@-@s ranking machinist than its chief ideologue. </s> <s> He vows, for example, to @-@grow@-@ the party in each state and knit it more closely together by having the national committee pay state executive directors@-@ salaries. </s> <s> The party@-@s organizing and fund-raising powers were upgraded in the last elections, but the G.

several conservative Republican judicial nominees made when asked whether their blunt personal statements opposing abortion rights and same-sex marriages would affect their performance on the bench.

interests of the nation@-@s conservative religious community. </s> <s> In her letter, Judge Neff said she had attended the ceremony in Massachusetts as a guest, not as a presiding jurist. </s> <s> As the ceremony occurred before Massachusetts@-@s highest court approved same-sex unions, it did not have any legal validity. </s> <s> One of the women in the ceremony, Judge Neff wrote, was the daughter of a family who had lived next door for 26 years. </s> <s> She said the families were so close that the woman was, in effect, a part of her family and was like a big sister to her own daughters. </s>

Professor Fried said, and how one would rule on a case should not be inferred from that private activity. </s> <s> Further, he said, @-@It would be inappropriate for the judge to recuse herself from any such case because it is a judge@-@s duty to sit on cases@-@ unless there is a clear conflict of interest. </s> <s> There would be a genuine conflict of interest, he said, if the judge had a

Fried, who has been both a judge and the solicitor general of the United States. </s> <s> Judge Neff@-@s nomination was included in a package of more than a dozen nominees whose confirmation had been agreed upon by both Democrats and Republicans. </s> <s> Mr. Brownback@-@s objections held up the whole roster of nominees. </s> <s> Mr. Brownback said that when Judge Neff was renominated in January,

Harvard-trained doctor who refused to criticize a federal abstinence program that catered to the religious right by spreading the canard that sweat and tears could transmit AIDS. </s> <s> Senator Frist is now a lame duck, and his brand of pandering, typified by his errant upbeat diagnosis of the brain-dead Terri Schiavo@-@s condition, is following him to political Valhalla. </s> <s> The 2006

that today@-@s conservative hierarchy is much like Roy Cohn@-@s milieu in @-@Angels in America,@-@ minus the wit and pathos. </s> <s> This time around, ballot initiatives banning same-sex marriage drew markedly less support than in 2004; the draconian one endorsed by Mr. McCain in Arizona was voted down altogether. </s> <s> Two national politicians who had kowtowed egregiously to their

keeping time with a male prostitute. </s> <s> There@-@s no evidence that Mr. Romney@-@s rightward move on gay civil rights and abortion @-@about which he acknowledges his flip-flop@-@ has helped him politically. </s> <s> Or that Mr. McCain has benefited from a similar sea change that has taken him from accurately labeling Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson @-@agents of intolerance@-@ in 2000 to appearing at Mr. Falwell@-@s Liberty University this year. </s> <s> A Washington Post-ABC News poll last week found that among Republican voters, Rudy Giuliani, an unabashed liberal on gay civil

wannabe, the religious-right favorite Sam Brownback, who has held up a federal judicial nomination in the Senate because the nominee had attended a lesbian neighbor@-@s commitment ceremony. </s> <s> For those who are cheered by seeing the Rovian politics of wedge issues start to fade, the good news does not end with the growing evidence that gay-baiting may do candidates who traffic in it more harm than good. </s> <s> It@-@s not only centrist American voters of both parties who reject divisive demagoguery but also conservative evangelicals themselves. </s> <s> Some of them are at last

Adam NagourneyWASHINGTON, Dec. 3 - Senator Barack Obama@-@s announcement that he might run for president is altering the early dynamics of the 2008 Democratic nominating contest. </s> <s> The move has created complications for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton as she steps up her own preparations and is posing a threat to lesser-known Democrats trying to position themselves as alternatives to Mrs. Clinton, Democrats said Sunday. </s> <s> The declaration six weeks ago by Mr. Obama, an Illinois Democrat, has set off a surge of interest in Democratic circles, which party officials expect will only be fueled in the coming week as Mr. Obama prepares for a day of campaignlike events in New Hampshire next Sunday. </s> <s> At the least, Mr. Obama@-@s very high-profile explorations have contributed to a quickening of the pace across the 2008 Democratic field. </s> <s> On Sunday, Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana said that he would create a presidential exploratory committee this week. </s> <s> And Gov. </s> <s> Tom Vilsack of Iowa went so far as to announce his candidacy two years before Election Day, in what his aides said was a calculated strategy to grab a moment of attention before Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton blot out the sun. </s> <s> Mrs. Clinton has been meeting in recent days with New York Democrats including a two-hour brunch on Sunday at the Manhattan apartment of Gov.-elect Eliot Spitzer to telegraph her own likely entry into the race, though her aides said the get-together had been planned before Mr. Obama discussed his possible run publicly. </s> <s> But more than simply picking up the pace, Democrats increasingly believe that Mr. Obama has the potential of upending the dynamics of the 2008 contest more than any other Democrat who might run short, perhaps, of Al Gore, the former vice president, whom some Democrats are pressing to run. </s> <s> In Mr. Obama, Democrats have a prospective candidate who both underlines and compensates for the potential weaknesses that worry many Democrats about Mrs. Clinton. </s> <s> He is a fervent opponent of the war in Iraq, and Democrats see him as an exceedingly warm campaigner with a compelling personality and a striking ability to command a crowd. </s> <s> He has no known major political baggage @-@though he has yet to encounter anything approaching the level of scrutiny Mrs. Clinton has undergone during her years in public life@-@. </s> <s> And Mr. Obama can even match Mrs. Clinton@-@s arresting political storyline if he tries to became the nation@-@s first black president as she seeks to become its first female president. </s> <s> But whatever complications he might pose for Mrs. Clinton are dwarfed by the shadow he is throwing over lesser-known Democrats. </s> <s> Almost without exception, they have approached this race with the same strategy: to try to emerge as the alternative to Mrs. Clinton and take advantage of substantial reservations in Democratic circles about her potential to win the White House. </s> <s> There is only so much money, seasoned political expertise and media attention to go around, so the prospect of Mr. Obama eyeing the presidential nomination is understandably

Kenneth Blackwell, a Republican who came under fire for simultaneously overseeing the 2004 election and serving as co-chairman of President Bush@-@s re-election campaign in Ohio. </s> <s> She ordered the study as part of a pledge to overhaul voting after problems made headlines for hours-long lines in the 2000 and 2004 elections and a scandal in Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, that led to the convictions of two elections workers on charges of rigging recounts. </s> <s> Ms. Brunner@-@s office temporarily seized control of that county@-@s board of elections. </s> <s> The study released Friday found that voting machines and central servers made by Elections Systems and Software; Premier Election Solutions, formerly Diebold; and Hart InterCivic; were easily corrupted. </s> <s> Chris Riggall, a Premier spokesman, said hardware and software problems had been corrected in his company@-@s new products, which will be available for installation in 2008. </s> <s> @-@It is important to note,@-@ he said, @-@that there has not been a single documented case of a successful attack against an electronic voting system, in Ohio or anywhere in the United States. </s> <s> @-@ Ken Fields, a spokesman for Election Systems and Software, said his company strongly disagreed with some of the report@-@s findings. </s> <s> @-@We can also tell you that our 35 years in the field of elections has demonstrated that Election Systems and Software voting technology is accurate, reliable and secure,@-@ he said. </s> <s> The @-@1.9 million federally financed study assembled corporate and academic teams to conduct parallel assessments. </s> <s> A bipartisan group of 12 election board directors and deputy directors acted as advisers. </s> <s> The academic team, made up of faculty members and students from Cleveland State University, Pennsylvania State, the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of Pennsylvania, said systemic change was needed. </s> <s> @-@All of the studied systems possess critical security failures that render their technical controls insufficient to guarantee a trustworthy election,@-@ the team wrote. </s> <s> In addition to switching machines, Ms. Brunner recommended eliminating polling stations that are used for fewer than five precincts as a cost-cutting measure, and introducing early voting 15 days before Election Day. </s> <s> David BrooksBy David Brooks The 2008 presidential election has fundamentally shifted, but it hasn@-@t been because of events in Iowa and New Hampshire. </s> <s> It@-@s because of events everywhere else. </s> <s> In Washington, the National Intelligence Estimate was released, suggesting the next president will not face an imminent nuclear showdown with Iran. </s> <s> In Iraq, the surge and tribal revolts produce increasing stability. </s> <s> In Pakistan, the streets have not exploded. </s> <s> In the Middle East, the Arabs and Palestinians stumble toward some sort of peace process. </s> <s> In Venezuela, a referendum set President Hugo Ch@-@vez back on his heels. </s> <s> The world still has its problems, but it no longer seems to be building toward some larger crisis. </s> <s> The atmosphere of fear and conflict has at least temporarily abated. </s> <s> With the change in conditions, the election of 2008 is beginning to feel like a postwar election. </s> <s> American voters are coming out of the shells constructed after Sept. 11th and are looking for a new normalcy. </s> <s> They@-@re looking for something entirely different. </s> <s> The shift in public sentiment has been evident in the polls. </s> <s> Before the 2004 election, half of all voters listed terrorism as their top concern. </s> <s> But, according to a Wall Street Journal@-@NBC poll, roughly a third do today. </s> <s> As Peter Beinart, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, has noted, the number of New Hampshirites who cite Iraq as their top concern has dropped 14 points among Republicans and 16 points among Democrats. </s> <s> The shift has also been evident in the candidates@-@ town meetings. </s> <s> The number of audience questions about Iraq has dropped precipitously. </s> <s> Republicans don@-@t want to talk about Iraq because they@-@re humiliated by the conduct of the war, and Democrats don@-@t want to talk about it because they were wrong about the surge. </s> <s> Instead, other issues have leapt to the front of public consciousness: Mormonism, mortgages and the cosmic importance of Oprah Winfrey. </s> <s> The effects of the atmospheric shift are only beginning to be felt. </s> <s> If voters in next year@-@s election are like those in the last election cycles, then 20 percent of them will likely make up their minds during the final three days of the campaign and another 20 percent or 30 percent will make their decision during the last couple of weeks. </s> <s> All that you@-@ve been reading about the race over the past year is trivial compared to this question: Which candidacy best matches the zeitgeist of the closing days? </s> <s> The first obvious feature of a postwar election is that domestic issues matter more. </s> <s> The two candidates who have been surging, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican Mike Huckabee, have almost no foreign policy experience between them. </s> <s> @-@ But the more comprehensive difference between a wartime election and a postwar election is that there is a shift in values. </s> <s> In wartime, leadership traits like courage, steadfastness and ruthlessness are prized. </s> <s> Voters are willing to vote for candidates they distrust so long as they seem tough and effective @-@Hillary Clinton, Rudy Giuliani@-@. </s> <s> In a postwar election things are different. </s> <s> When Wall Street Journal@-@NBC pollsters asked voters what qualities they were looking for in the next leader, their top three choices were: the ability to work well with leaders of other countries; having strong moral and family values; bringing unity to the country. </s> <s> Those are cooperative qualities, not combative ones. </s> <s> They require good listening skills, openness and the ability to compromise. </s> <s> It@-@s clear that voters are not only exhausted by the war, they are exhausted by the war over the war. </s> <s> On the Democratic side, Obama captured the mood exactly with his Jefferson-Jackson Day speech of a few weeks ago. </s> <s> In that speech, he asked voters to reject fear, partisanship and textbook politics. </s> <s> He asked them to vote instead on the basis of their aspirations for a new era of national unity. </s> <s> As a result, Obama has pulled ahead in Iowa and approached parity in New Hampshire. </s> <s> @-@ The tragedy of the Republican race is that Mitt Romney and Giuliani, who could have offered a new kind of Republicanism, opted to run as conventional Bush-era Republicans. </s> <s> Now Huckabee has emerged as the fresh alternative. </s> <s> Huckabee is socially conservative, but not a partisan culture warrior. </s> <s> He@-@s a pragmatic gubernatorial Republican, not a rigid creature of the beltway interest groups. </s> <s> My guess is that this race has a few more twists and turns. </s> <s> Something terrible could happen in the world, in which case the wartime mentality would be back in spades. </s> <s> Obama and Huckabee could beat Clinton and Romney, respectively, in the early states, only to fall victim to their own weaknesses later on. </s> <s> You laugh, but this thing could still spin into the lap of Fred Thompson or John McCain, Chris Dodd or Joe Biden. </s> <s> @-@ The main point is this: money and organization matter less right now than getting in tune with the zeitgeist shift. </s> <s> In 1945, Prime Minister Winston Churchill had formidable advantages over Clement Attlee. </s> <s> But when a public turns from a war mentality to a peace mentality, it turns with a vengeance @-@ even though in this case no armistice has been declared. </s> <s> By Adam Nagourney and Jeff ZelenyDES MOINES @-@ Senator Barack Obama is on the hunt for Iowans who have never participated in the state@-@s

caucuses in the past and who, because of age, sex or other characteristics, seem likely to support her, starting with independent women over 65 or under 30. </s> <s> John Edwards is taking a more traditional approach, working through the official list of Democrats who showed up to choose a candidate in 2004, as his campaign tries to ensure that it has the name of every likely voter who might be on his side when Iowans gather in 1,781 precinct caucuses across the state on Thursday night. </s> <s> The ground war @-@ the laborious, unglamorous process of identifying supporters and making

exploded into the most ambitious and costly in the history of this state@-@s presidential caucus system, and it puts on display the sharply diverging strategies the candidates are pursuing as they hurtle toward the first real test of the 2008 campaign. </s> <s> @-@ Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama are trying to expand the tiny universe of caucusgoers, a fundamental shift in the way candidates have approached the Iowa caucuses. </s> <s> Mr. Edwards is focusing mainly on voters who have reliably voted in the past. </s> <s> The developments reflect the tightness of the race @-@ another poll Friday

anyone in the race, said in an interview in his office on Friday. </s> <s> @-@The get-out-the-vote efforts are going to be the best ever. </s> <s> @-@On the Republican side, Mitt Romney is also making an intense effort to turn out his supporters to stave off Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor who polls suggest has made a late surge that gives him a chance of victory. </s> <s> Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, has spent more than a year building a turnout organization that proved its effectiveness at the Iowa Straw Poll in Ames this summer and that he is now counting on to turn back a stiff challenge from Mr. Huckabee, who is relying largely on word-of-mouth and a network of volunteers, his aides said. </s> <s> Many of the other Republican candidates are making only token efforts here. </s> <s> So most of the on-the-ground organizing is being done by the leading Democrats, and that was becoming increasingly visible as the candidates and their supporters fanned out across the state this weekend. </s> <s> Mrs. Clinton@-@s office here is filled with hundreds of new green snow shovels that were being strategically distributed on Saturday to precinct captains to clear the walks of older women who might be particularly wary of going out to the caucuses in bad weather. </s> <s> The campaign has printed doorknob hangers with caucus locations printed in extra-large type, also to accommodate these older first-time caucusers. </s> <s> @-@We have had a significant challenge here in that our people are older and mostly new,@-@ said Karen Hicks, a senior campaign adviser for Mrs. Clinton. </s> <s> @-@But we@-@ve understood what our challenges were for a long time. </s> <s> This is not a problem you could have dealt with at the last moment. </s> <s> @-@ Mrs. Clinton@-@s campaign has contracted with a local supermarket chain to deliver platters of sandwiches for pre-caucus parties at caucus sites late Thursday afternoon. </s> <s> The idea is to entice people to arrive early and thus give Clinton aides time to see who has not shown up and get them to the caucus before the doors close at 7 p.m. </s> <s> This city is teeming with Democratic strategists who are renowned in their party for knowing how to organize the caucuses or use sophisticated computer models and consumer data to find people who might not otherwise vote but could be open to backing particular candidates. </s> <s> Mrs. Clinton is banking on Teresa Vilmain, who has worked in Iowa presidential caucuses for over 20 years, and Ms. Hicks, a former national field director for the Democratic National Committee. </s> <s> Mr. Obama and Mr. Edwards have similarly respected operatives running their caucus operation, including David Plouffe and Steve Hildebrand for Mr. Obama. </s> <s> Jennifer O@-@Malley Dillon is running Mr. Edwards@-@s Iowa campaign for a second time. </s> <s> Mrs. Clinton, of New York, and Mr. Obama, of Illinois, are betting that they can use computer-driven research to expand the relatively small pool of caucusgoers. </s> <s> But all the Democrats have built large staffs, with members knocking on doors, making phone calls and keeping detailed records of which Iowans have pledged their support and which might be open to persuasion. </s> <s> Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama, in particular, are spending lavishly on door-to-door canvassers, repeated and often elaborate mailings and novelty items to help hook potential supporters. </s> <s> The Clinton campaign has mailed refrigerator magnets marked with the caucus date to the women they have identified as first-time caucusgoers who might determine her fate. </s> <s> Mr. Obama has promised baby-sitting to any parent who needs it caucus night. </s> <s> @-@It is definitely the most highly organized caucus of all time,@-@ said Michael Whouley, a veteran Iowa caucus organizer, who is supporting Mrs. Clinton but is one of the few major Democratic strategists who have not come to Iowa for this fight. </s> <s> As part of their effort to find first-time caucusgoers, the Clinton and the Obama campaigns have brought to Iowa the type of sophisticated voter identification models, using detailed demographic and consumer data, employed by the Republican National Committee beginning in 2002. </s> <s> Starting in the summer, the campaigns used that data to find Iowans who had not caucused before and who might be inclined to support their candidate. </s> <s> It was that kind of research that led Mrs. Clinton to determine, for example, that women over 65 were inclined to support her, in particular widows or married women, but only those married to a Democrat or independent. </s> <s> Using that model and state election records, they searched for Iowans who had voted in regular elections but had not caucused. </s> <s> Mr. Obama did much the same thing with, for example, independent voters under 50. </s> <s> They dispatched canvassers to make multiple personal visits to the homes of those people, a decision reflecting the determination by both campaigns that Iowa voters have been so deluged with telephone calls that they could not rely on telephone banks typically used. </s> <s> Because research conducted by her campaign found that many Iowans who supported Mrs. Clinton but had never caucused before found the process intimidating or baffling, her aides showed up at the homes of those voters with DVD@-@s that explained how the caucuses work. </s> <s> @-@It@-@s always hard to expand the base,@-@ Mr. Culver said. </s> <s> @-@But if there was ever a year when we could have another 20,000 people turn up, this is it. </s> <s> @-@At the Edwards headquarters, Ms. Dillon said she doubted there would be a significant increase in voters. </s> <s> She expressed skepticism that her rivals@-@ expenditures on mailings, gifts and personal contacts would bear fruit. </s> <s> @-@Iowa voters are not going to say, @-@Oh my God! </s> <s> I got a bumper sticker. </s> <s> I should caucus! </s> <s> @-@ @-@ she said. </s> <s> The intensity of the effort is fueled by the decisions of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama to decline public campaign financing. </s> <s> They are thus not constrained by the spending ceilings of the campaign finance system that restrict Mr. Edwards, of North Carolina, who is using public money. </s> <s> Mrs. Clinton@-@s campaign, in the first mailing to first-time caucusgoers who pledge to support her, includes porcelain lapel pins identifying them as Clinton supporters. </s> <s> Mrs. Clinton looks for women wearing those pins at her events and praises them for caucusing for the first time. </s> <s> Mr. Obama is focusing on younger voters, who have brought considerable energy to his campaign but who as a group have not tended to turn out to vote in large numbers in past presidential elections. </s> <s> As supporters walk into a campaign stop for Mr. Obama, separate lines are designated for high school and college students to receive specific instructions for caucus night. </s> <s> After his speech, he holds a brief meeting and photograph session with his young supporters who belong to a program called Barack Stars. </s> <s> Obama supporters of all ages receive a yellow slip of paper @-@ a @-@Ticket to Change@-@ @-@ with directions to their caucus site and a telephone hot line @-@one for each of Iowa@-@s five area

microtargeting. </s> <s> Maps of Mr. Strasma@-@s efforts hang throughout the campaign@-@s state headquarters on Locust Street here, color-coded with shades of prospective pockets of supportersTo find its supporters, the Obama campaign spent months developing models of who their likely supporters would be, focusing particularly on previous caucus voters as well as Iowans who voted in the 2006

campaign moves into high gear. </s> <s> And with more money than ever on the line this time around, resentment has been building, donors and other operatives say, at how, win or lose, presidential elections have become gold mines for the small and often swaggering band of media consultants who dominate modern campaigns. </s> <s> As a result, the Democratic presidential hopefuls are seeking to impose more controls on the consultants. </s> <s> In doing so, they are moving more into line with their Republican counterparts, who by and large have kept tighter rein on how they handle their media

consultants in both parties will continue to be paid handsomely for their work in the 2008 campaign, and their business continues to be one of the largest and most lucrative in politics. </s> <s> But beyond the internal pressures to limit payments to consultants, campaigns face increasing pressure from the Internet as an alternative for disseminating political videos. </s> <s> That development is reducing reliance on expensive television advertising time, diminishing the control of consultants over their candidates@-@ images and threatening more fundamental changes. </s> <s> Already, the shift in the way consultants are being paid is far-reaching. </s> <s> The old approach allowed the fees to shoot up with increases in advertising in hotly contested races. </s> <s> Critics say it also

traveled to 79 countries in total, little of it leisure; one meeting with mutilated Rwandan refugees so unsettled her that she threw up afterward. </s> <s> But during those two terms in the White House, Mrs. Clinton did not hold a security clearance. </s> <s> She did not attend National Security Council meetings. </s> <s> She was not given a copy of the president@-@s daily intelligence briefing. </s> <s> She did not assert herself on the crises in Somalia, Haiti and Rwanda. </s> <s> And during one of President Bill Clinton@-@s major tests on terrorism, whether to bomb Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998, Mrs. Clinton was barely speaking to her husband, let alone advising him, as the Lewinsky scandal sizzled. </s> <s> In seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, Mrs. Clinton lays claim to two traits nearly every day: strength and experience. </s> <s> But as the junior senator from New York, she has few significant legislative accomplishments to her name. </s> <s> She has cast herself, instead, as a first lady like no other: a full partner to her husband in his administration, and, she says, all the stronger and more experienced for her @-@eight years with a front-row seat on history. </s> <s> @-@Her rivals scoff at the idea that her background gives her any special qualifications for the presidency. </s> <s> Senator Barack Obama has especially questioned @-@what experiences she@-@s claiming@-@ as first lady, noting that the job is not the same as being a cabinet member, much less president. </s> <s> And late last week, Mr. Obama suggested that more foreign policy experts from the Clinton administration were supporting his candidacy than hers; his campaign released a list naming about 45 of them, and said that others were not ready to go public. </s> <s> Mrs. Clinton quickly put out a list of 80 who were supporting her, and plans to release another 75 names on Wednesday. </s> <s> @-@ Mrs. Clinton@-@s role in her most high-profile assignment as first lady, the failed health care initiative of the early 1990s, has been well documented. </s> <s> Yet little has been made public about her involvement in foreign policy and national security as first lady. </s> <s> Documents about her work remain classified at the National Archives. </s> <s> Mrs. Clinton has declined to divulge the private advice she gave her husband. </s> <s> An interview with Mrs. Clinton, conversations with 35 Clinton administration officials and a review of books about her White House years suggest that she was more of a sounding board than a policy maker, who learned through osmosis rather than decision-making, and who grew gradually more comfortable with the use of military power. </s> <s> Her time in the White House was a period of transition in foreign policy and national security, with the cold war over and the threat of Islamic terrorism still emerging. </s> <s> As a result, while in the White House, she was never fully a part of either the old school that had been focused on the Soviet Union and the possibility of nuclear war or the more recent strain of national security thinking defined by issues like nonstate threats and the proliferation of nuclear technology. </s> <s> Associates from that time said that she was aware of Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden and what her husband has in recent years characterized as his intense focus on them, but that she made no aggressive independent effort to shape policy or gather information about the threat of terrorism. </s> <s> She did not wrestle directly with many of the other challenges the next president will face, including managing a large-scale deployment @-@ or withdrawal @-@ of troops abroad, an overhaul of the intelligence agencies or the effort to halt the spread of nuclear weapons technology. </s> <s> Most of her exposure to the military has come since she left the White House through her seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. </s> <s> When it came to the regional conflicts in the Balkans, she, along with many officials, was cautious at first about supporting American military intervention, though she later backed air strikes against the Serbs and the NATO-led peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. </s> <s> Her role mostly involved what diplomats call @-@soft power@-@ @-@ converting cold war foes into friends, supporting nonprofit work and good-will endeavors, and pressing her agenda on women@-@s rights, human trafficking and the expanded use of microcredits, tiny loans to help individuals in poor countries start small businesses. </s> <s> Asked to name three major foreign policy decisions where she played a decisive role as first lady, Mrs. Clinton responded in generalities more than specifics, describing her strategic roles on trips to Bosnia, Kosovo, Northern Ireland, India, Africa and Latin America. </s> <s> Asked to cite a significant foreign policy object lesson from the 1990s, Mrs. Clinton also replied with broad observations. </s> <s> @-@There are a lot of them,@-@ she said. </s> <s> @-@The whole unfortunate experience we@-@ve had with the Bush administration, where they haven@-@t done what we@-@ve needed to do to reach out to the rest of the world, reinforces my experience in the 1990s that public diplomacy, showing respect and understanding of people@-@s different perspectives @-@ it@-@s more likely to at least create the conditions where we can exercise our values and pursue our interests. </s> <s> @-@ Crisis at Home and Terror AfarThere were times, though, when Mrs. Clinton did not appear deeply involved in some of Mr. Clinton@-@s hardest moments on national security. </s> <s> He faced a major one in 1998 @-@ the bombings of the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and subsequently whether to bomb Afghanistan and Sudan. </s> <s> Just days after he acknowledged to his wife, the public and a grand jury that he had had a relationship with Monica Lewinsky, Mr. Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on targets suspected to be a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan and a chemical weapons factory in Sudan. </s> <s> @-@It was the height of Monica, and they were barely talking to each other, if at all,@-@ said one senior national security official who spoke with both Clintons during that time. </s> <s> Asked if she talked to the president about the military choices or advised him, regardless of their personal problems, Mrs. Clinton was elliptical. </s> <s> @-@I was very proud of him, he did what he thought he was supposed to do as president based on the best intelligence he had,@-@ she said. </s> <s> @-@And he was well aware that there would be those that would certainly criticize him for it. </s> <s> @-@ Friends of Mrs. Clinton say that she acted as adviser, analyst, devil@-@s advocate, problem-solver and gut check for her husband, and that she has an intuitive sense of how brutal the job can be. </s> <s> What is clear, she and others say, is that Mr. Clinton often consulted her, and that Mrs. Clinton gained experience that Mr. Obama, John Edwards and every other candidate lack @-@ indeed, that most incoming presidents did not have. </s> <s> @-@In the end, she was the last court of appeal for him when he was making a decision,@-@ said Mickey Kantor, a close Clinton friend who served as trade representative and commerce secretary. </s> <s> @-@I would be surprised if there was any major decision he made that she didn@-@t weigh in on. </s> <s> @-@ @-@Mr. Clinton declined an interview request. </s> <s> @-@But other administration officials, as well as opponents of Mrs. Clinton, are skeptical that the couple@-@s conversations and her 79 trips add up to unique experience that voters should reward. </s> <s> She was not independently judging intelligence, for the most part, or mediating the data, egos and agendas of a national security team. </s> <s> And, in the end, she did not feel or process the weight of responsibility. </s> <s> Susan Rice, a National Security Council senior aide and State Department official under Mr. Clinton who now advises Mr. Obama, said Mrs. Clinton was not involved in @-@the heavy lifting of foreign policy. </s> <s> @-@ Ms. Rice also took issue with a recent comment by a Clinton campaign official that Mrs. Clinton was @-@the face of the administration in foreign affairs. </s> <s> @-@Making tough decisions, responding to crises,

expected to do as first lady. </s> <s> @-@Not Overstepping Her Bounds Mrs. Clinton said in the interview that she was careful not to overstep her bounds on national security, relying instead on informal access. </s> <s> During the preinaugural transition, for instance, she sat in on some meetings about presidential appointments at the invitation of Warren Christopher, who directed the transition and became secretary of state in the first Clinton term. </s> <s> Participants recalled that she would mostly speak when Mr. Christopher called on her, and tended to make points about placing more women, minority members and allies in key jobs. </s> <s> She said she did not attend National Security Council meetings, nor did she have a security clearance @-@ though she was briefed on classified intelligence before going on some important diplomatic trips. </s> <s> @-@I don@-@t recall attending anything formal like the National Security Council,@-@ she said, @-@because I had

a candidate with declining national poll numbers and a history of treatment for prostate cancer would just as soon avoid after he abruptly entered the hospital in St. Louis and stayed there overnight. </s> <s> His aides declined to provide details of what had happened to Mr. Giuliani, other than he was complaining of flulike symptoms, or what tests he might have undergone. </s> <s> The situation grew even more muddled when Mr. Giuliani disputed what his campaign had said about his condition, saying that in fact he had been suffering from a severe headache and that his doctor would be able to issue a definitive statement this week after seeing test results. </s> <s> As a result of all this, what might have been a one-day campaign trail story was still reverberating on Sunday. </s> <s> Mr.

Republican National Committee, was featured prominently on the editorial page of The Concord Monitor on Sunday, greeting Mr. Giuliani on a day when he had two campaign events in New Hampshire. </s> <s> Mr. Giuliani is still viewed as a very strong candidate with continued high potential in a very unsettled field. </s> <s> He could be helped by the unusual calendar of nominating contests, with the chance it provides for him to pick up large numbers of delegates on Feb. 5 and recover from any early setbacks. </s> <s> @-@We have always run a campaign that is based on a long-term strategy of

block Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton were she to win the Democratic nomination. </s> <s> But issues like immigration are proving far more decisive among Republicans than terrorism, especially since the violence in Iraq has diminished. </s> <s> Mrs. Clinton is struggling to win her own party@-@s nomination, which has had the effect of undercutting what had been one of Mr. Giuliani@-@s biggest selling points. </s> <s> Mr. Giuliani@-@s closest advisers in this campaign include a number of longtime loyalists who, though seasoned in New York City politics, have not run a national campaign before. </s> <s> One of the key questions from the start of his entry into the race has been the extent to which Mr. Giuliani would open up this circle @-@ a small, rarely changing circle of hard-driving New Yorkers, known for tough language and tough tactics @-@ to advisers with national experience. </s> <s> To a certain extent, he has done this. </s> <s> Acting on the recommendation of Ken Mehlman, the former Republican National Committee chairman, Mr. Giuliani named Mr. DuHaime, a former political director of the Republican National Committee, as his campaign director, and Mr. DuHaime brought a number of veterans of the Republican committee with him. </s> <s> But Republicans who have dealt with the campaign say that it is more Anthony Carbonetti, along with other New York insiders, who has Mr. Giuliani@-@s ear, and who is, with the former mayor, driving many of the major decisions in the campaign. </s> <s> Mr. Carbonetti, who has been a senior adviser to Mr. Giuliani since his early days in New York politics, has continued working at Mr. Giuliani@-@s consulting firm, Giuliani Partners, and spends much of his time not at Mr. Giuliani@-@s campaign headquarters in

</s> <s> And I think in terms of the political success I enjoyed, people have given more credit to my political skills than they deserve and less credit to the weight, the body of the ideas. </s> <s> @-@ At the end of that interview, as he walked me to the lobby, Clinton mentioned a favorite quote from Machiavelli@-@s book @-@The Prince@-@ and told me to look it up. </s> <s> When I got back to Washington, I thumbed through the book until I found the rambling passage, and this is what it said:It must be considered that there is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than to initiate a new order of things. </s> <s> For the reformer has enemies in all those who profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all those who would profit by the new order, this lukewarmness arriving partly from fear of their adversaries,@-@ who have the laws in their favor; and partly from the incredulity of@-@ mankind, who do not truly believe in anything new until they have had an@-@ actual experience of it. </s> <s> Thus it arises that on every opportunity for attacking@-@ the reformer, the opponents do so with the zeal of partisans, the others only@-@ defend him halfheartedly, so that between them he runs great danger. </s> <s> It@-@s not hard to see why the postpresidential Bill Clinton sees himself in this quotation, and it says a lot about how he views his own place in American politics. </s> <s> In Clinton@-@s mind, the New Democrats of the late @-@80s and early @-@90s and their @-@third way@-@ approach represented a call for fundamental reform, not just of the Democratic Party but also of the country@-@s industrial-age government. </s> <s> For that, he has been pilloried by Republican business interests, who were doing just fine under the old system, and @-@lukewarmly@-@ defended by Democrats who resist any real break with the past. </s> <s> There are, among Democrats, dueling interpretations of what Clintonism means and how it came into being. </s> <s> The most popular version now, by far, is that Clintonism was chiefly an electoral strategy, a way of making Democrats sound more acceptable to conservative voters by softening the party@-@s stances on @-@values@-@ issues like guns, welfare and abortion and introducing pallid, focus-grouped phrases like @-@work hard and play by the rules@-@ and making abortion @-@safe, legal and rare. </s> <s> @-@ In other words, Clinton was basically as liberal at heart as any other Democrat who marched for civil rights and protested the Vietnam War, but he was a brilliant political strategist who instinctively understood the need to rebrand the party. </s> <s> Even some of Clinton@-@s friends from the old days @-@ those lukewarm defenders of the faith @-@ accept this basic version of history. </s> <s> @-@Clintonism was about winning,@-@ says Susan Estrich, the longtime Democratic strategist and pundit. </s> <s> @-@It was about grabbing victory from the jaws of defeat. </s> <s> If you were a Democrat of a certain age, it was like being a Red Sox fan @-@ you never won. </s> <s> And even when you won, you lost, because you got Jimmy Carter. </s> <s> Clinton led us out of the desert when no one else could. </s> <s> @-@ On the other hand, Clinton@-@s more ardent supporters, those few who were there at the beginning, argue that Democrats have badly miscast him as an expedient strategist, when in fact he was a visionary and a modernizer. </s> <s> @-@He used to tell me all the time, @-@One of these days, people are going to figure out that I actually believe in this stuff,@-@ @-@ Al From told me recently. </s> <s> From and the Democratic Leadership Council that he founded in the 1980s have in recent years become a kind of convenient stand-in for Clinton, the main object of acid derision from liberal bloggers who prefer to savage someone other than the former president himself for the evils of Clintonism. </s> <s> Clinton was the chairman of the D. L. C. when he ran for president, and much of his campaign rhetoric came from its work. </s> <s> @-@I don@-@t want to see what I think is his greatest achievement diminished,@-@ From told me. </s> <s> @-@Just as Franklin Roosevelt saved capitalism by dealing with its excesses, Clinton saved progressive governance, and he saved progressive governance all over the world. </s> <s> @-@Clinton@-@s critics on the left may scoff at this idea, but it@-@s fair to say that the discussion of Clintonism among party activists and especially online often displays a stunning lack of historical perspective. </s> <s> For a lot of younger Democrats, in particular, whose political consciousness dates back only as far as 1994 or even to the more recent days of Clinton@-@s impeachment, the origins of Clintonism have become not only murky but also irrelevant. </s> <s> @-@Clintonism@-@ is, in much of the Democratic activist universe, a synonym for spinelessly appeasing Republicans in order to win, an establishment philosophy assumed to comprise no inherent principles of its own. </s> <s> Lost in all this is the fact that, back in the day, Clinton and his New Democrats were themselves the outsiders taking on the ruling interest groups of the Democratic establishment the analog to bloggers and MoveOn.org activists, albeit from a different ideological direction. </s> <s> And it took no small amount of courage, at the end of the Reagan era, to argue inside the Democratic Party that the liberal orthodoxies of the New Deal and the Great Society, as well as the culture of the antiwar and civil rights movements, had become excessive and inflexible. </s> <s> Not only were Democratic attitudes toward government electorally problematic, Clinton argued; they were just plain wrong for the time. </s> <s> Immediately after assuming the chairmanship of the D. L. C. in 1990, Clinton issued something called the New Orleans Declaration, which laid out the D. L. C.@-@s attack on old liberalism in a series of 15 core principles. </s> <s> By today@-@s standards, these principles don@-@t amount to much more than typical Clintonian rhetoric, but at the time, they seemed like a good way for a young Democratic governor to permanently marginalize himself in a party dominated by Big Labor, civil rights leaders and Northeastern liberals. </s> <s> Among the stated principles in the manifesto:@-@We believe that economic growth is the prerequisite to expanding opportunity for everyone. </s> <s> The free market, regulated in the public interest, is the best engine of general prosperity. </s> <s> @-@We believe in preventing crime and punishing criminals, not in explaining away their behavior. </s> <s> @-@We believe the purpose of social welfare is to bring the poor into the nation@-@s economic mainstream, not to maintain them in dependence. </s> <s> @-@In 1991, as Clinton prepared for what was then considered a quixotic run for president against a popular incumbent, he expanded on his governing philosophy in a series of speeches that, revisited now, are striking both for their confrontational approach toward expansive liberal government @-@ especially coming from a candidate who needed party regulars to win @-@ and for their ideological consistency with what would later come to pass during the Clinton era. </s> <s> He laid out a forceful case for improving and decentralizing decades-old institutions, from public schools to welfare, and modeling government after corporate America. </s> <s> He talked about revamping a Democratic Party that for 30 years was closely identified with the problems of the poor and retooling it to address the anxieties of a distressed middle class. </s> <s> @-@There is an idea abroad in the land that if you abandon your children, the government will raise them,@-@ Clinton said at a D. L. C. gathering in Cleveland in 1991, referring to fathers in the inner city. </s> <s> @-@I will let you in on a secret. </s> <s> Governments do not raise children @-@ people do. </s> <s> And it@-@s time they were asked to assume their responsibilities and forced to do so if they refuse. </s> <s> @-@In the same speech, Clinton outlined a new Democratic ethos based on the idea of consumer choice. </s> <s> @-@In the information age, monopoly decisions handed down on high by government bureaucracies are not always the best way to go,@-@ he said. </s> <s> @-@With appropriate protections against discrimination based on race or income, we can provide our people more choices: child-care vouchers, public-school choice options, job training programs, choices for the elderly. </s> <s> ...@-@Is what I just said to you liberal or conservative? </s> <s> @-@ he went on to ask. </s> <s> @-@The truth is, it is both, and it is different. </s> <s> It rejects the Republicans@-@ attacks and the Democrats@-@ previous unwillingness to consider new alternatives. </s> <s> @-@This, in a few lines, was the essence of Clintonism. </s> <s> Was it an innovative governing vision or a cynical strategy? </s> <s> The truth is, it was both. </s> <s> There is little doubt that as governor of Arkansas, Clinton believed passionately in the need to modernize liberalism and overhaul industrial-age programs, including popular entitlements and @-@welfare as we know it. </s> <s> @-@ He grew up in hard circumstances and was raising his own child in a household with two working parents; his concern for the middle class was real, and it reflected a changed reality for a lot of baby-boomer families that older Democrats simply didn@-@t comprehend. </s> <s> But Clinton also believed his centrist message was the only way for a Democrat to win in the era after McGovern and Mondale, when running as a liberal candidate seemed only slightly more practical than running as a Marxist. </s> <s> And in order to get his party@-@s nomination, Clinton had to convince beleaguered liberals not so much that he was right about the party@-@s philosophical irrelevance @-@ this probably wasn@-@t possible, in any event @-@ but that his was the only way to regain the White House. </s> <s> He sold Clintonism as a matter of conviction and a promising electoral strategy, and both were sincere propositions. </s> <s> Once in the White House, however, for some reasons within his control and many that were not, Clinton seemed to list inexorably toward the tactical side. </s> <s> He can claim some genuine advances in keeping with the spirit of his fundamental argument about government: the crime bill; welfare reform; the Family and Medical Leave Act; expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, which pulled millions of working Americans out of poverty. </s> <s> These weren@-@t small achievements, and Clinton has received less credit for them than he deserves. </s> <s> And whether you attribute to him any part of the technology boom that created a vast amount of American wealth or believe instead that he simply had the good fortune to happen upon it it@-@s only fair to acknowledge, as historians almost certainly will, that Clinton presided more than ably over a historic economic expansion, leaving the nation in far better fiscal shape than he found it. </s> <s> Still, a combination of events @-@ first the collapse of Hillary Clinton@-@s health-care plan, then the Republican Congressional takeover of 1994 and later, of course, the debilitating sex scandal that led to his impeachment @-@ seemed to drain the administration of its capital and ambition. </s> <s> Clinton@-@s presidency seemed, at least from the outside, to devolve into an exercise in deflection and survival, a string of near-death experiences that left little space or energy for whatever sweeping agenda Clinton @-@and his wife@-@ envisioned back in 1992. </s> <s> As the transformational governing vision of earlier years receded, bland, poll-tested rhetoric and endless scandals rushed in to fill the void @-@ and became, in the minds of many Democrats, the hallmarks of Clintonism. </s> <s> For a lot of liberals @-@those who now call themselves progressives@-@, the @-@90s were a conflicted time. </s> <s> They never really bought the ideological premise of Clintonism, and they quietly seethed as the president moved his party to the center @-@ enacting free-trade agreements over the objections of union leaders; embracing balanced budgets and telling Americans that @-@the era of big government is over@-@; striking a deal to give Republicans a long-sought overhaul of the welfare system. </s> <s> @-@In fact, Clinton had been talking about welfare reform for at least a decade before his presidency, but few Democrats believed his eventual support for the bill was anything other than a craven attempt to bolster his re-election prospects. </s> <s> @-@ They felt embarrassed by the Lewinsky affair and the sordid controversy that devoured Clinton@-@s second term like flesh-eating bacteria. </s> <s> There were five syllables that for these Democrats summed up all the failures of Clintonism: @-@triangulation. </s> <s> @-@ The word was originally popularized by Dick Morris, who advised Clinton in the dark days of the mid-@-@90s @-@and who, not incidentally, was brought in to the White House by the first lady@-@. </s> <s> Triangulation, as Morris intended it, is probably best described as the strategy of co-opting the issues that attract voters to your opponents by substituting centrist solutions for the ideological ones they propose, thus depriving them of victory. </s> <s> @-@In other words, if your opponents are getting traction with their demands to dismantle a broken welfare system, you acknowledge the problem but propose a middle-ground way of restructuring it instead. </s> <s> @-@ To a lot of avid Democrats, however, triangulation became shorthand for gutless compromise, for saying and doing whatever you think you must in order to win. </s> <s> No doubt Clinton@-@s style of leadership contributed to this impression as much as the substance did. </s> <s> There were moments, little remembered or appreciated by his critics, when Clinton demonstrated icy resolve and an indifference to polls: the budget showdown with Newt Gingrich and Congressional Republicans in 1995; the bombing of Serbia in 1999 to stop its aggression in Kosovo. </s> <s> More often, though, Clinton seemed determined to confirm his reputation as an agonized, late-night decision maker, a leader heavily influenced by the last guy to leave the room. </s> <s> Classic half-a-loaf policies like the @-@don@-@t ask, don@-@t tell@-@ rule for gays in the military, along with frequent paralysis over crises like the genocide in Rwanda, created what would become an enduring impression that Clintonism was code for fecklessness. </s> <s> Even so, such resentments were tempered by the fact that Clinton managed to deliver the White House not once but twice; among Democrats in the 20th century, only Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt had done the same. </s> <s> He almost single-handedly pulled the Democratic Party back from its slide into irrelevance. </s> <s> Liberals swallowed hard and endured Clinton@-@s pragmatic brand of politics because they assumed that Clinton@-@s success would beget more success and, ultimately, a more progressive government. </s> <s> Of course, it didn@-@t work out that way. </s> <s> First came the election of 2000, which Democrats believed was swiped from their grasp with little protest from the party@-@s Washington leaders. </s> <s> Next came compromises with George W. Bush on tax cuts and education reform. </s> <s> Then came the back-breaker: in the vote on the Iraq war resolution in 2002, many Democrats in Washington @-@ including, most conspicuously, Hillary Clinton, then an unannounced presidential candidate @-@ sided with President Bush in a move that antiwar liberals could only interpret as a Clintonian calculation to look tough on terror. </s> <s> If so, a lot of good it did; Congressional Democrats were demolished at the polls a few weeks later. </s> <s> After that defeat, many longtime liberals, often coming together in the new online political space, began to voice a different thought: What if they had gone along with Clintonism for nothing? </s> <s> What if the path to victory lay not in compromising with Republicans but in having the fortitude to fight ruthlessly and to defend your own convictions, no matter how unpopular they might be? </s> <s> This was the moment in which Howard Dean@-@s explosive presidential campaign @-@ and the grass-roots progressive movement it spawned @-@ began to flourish. </s> <s> It was grounded in the idea that Clintonism, far from representing the postindustrial evolution of Democratic thought, had corrupted the party of the New Deal and the Great Society @-@ and, taken to its logical end, had led Democrats and the country into a catastrophic war. </s> <s> Even before they knew for sure that she was running for the presidency, Hillary Clinton@-@s top aides had to figure out how best to handle the growing tumult inside their own party. </s> <s> As a senator, Clinton had been, if anything, more centrist than her husband; she worked across the aisle with the likes of Bill Frist and Lindsey Graham, and her voting record on foreign policy placed her among the most conservative Democrats, only a few paces to the left of Joe Lieberman. </s> <s> There is no reason to think such stances on the issues didn@-@t accurately reflect Hillary@-@s convictions, but they had the added bonus of positioning her as eminently moderate and @-@electable@-@ @-@ both in New York State, where she won 67 percent of the vote in her 2006 re-election, and in the rest of the country. </s> <s> The party, however, seemed to be moving in a different direction. </s> <s> Liberal activists online and in the states, in the wake of Dean@-@s losing campaign, were noisily demanding more confrontation and less Clintonian compromise from their Washington leaders. </s> <s> By the time Hillary Clinton formally announced her candidacy for president, a group of these activists @-@ money guys, bloggers, MoveOn.org @-@ had just combined forces to knock off Lieberman in a stunning primary upset @-@although Lieberman did manage to retain his seat in the general election@-@, and these same grass-roots Democrats were lashing out at Clinton for her vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq. </s> <s> Some Clinton supporters in Washington thought they could see an ominous train coming down the track, and they wondered if the candidate didn@-@t need to get some distance between herself and her husband@-@s legacy, to position herself as a more partisan Democrat before it was too late. </s> <s> Mark Penn steadfastly disagreed. </s> <s> Penn, who was Bill Clinton@-@s chief pollster during the @-@90s, also emerged as Hillary@-@s most influential strategist. </s> <s> Penn had argued for years, going back to the Clinton White House, that Democrats won when they occupied the bipartisan, common-sense center of the political spectrum. </s> <s> And even in a primary campaign, Penn said he believed that Democrats had such personal loyalty toward the Clintons that they would forgive a few ideological differences they might have with the senator, especially if they thought those differences made her palatable to a wide swath of independent voters. </s> <s> When I suggested to Penn, back in 2005, that there might be a strong backlash emerging against the notion of Clintonism, he waved me away. </s> <s> @-@Strong backlash? </s> <s> @-@ Penn scoffed, reminding me that the former president had a 70 percent approval rating in the country as a whole. </s> <s> @-@In this environment, that is a notion I would have to laugh at. </s> <s> @-@ In the end, Hillary Clinton tried to straddle the line. </s> <s> She broke with her husband in small but significant ways. </s> <s> She criticized the free-trade policies that he had long championed but that were now anathema to much of the Democratic base. </s> <s> She promised to abandon @-@don@-@t ask, don@-@t tell@-@ and to amend the Defense of Marriage Act, which Bill Clinton signed. </s> <s> At the same time, Hillary Clinton has, from the start, reminded voters that she was a crucial member of her husband@-@s White House. </s> <s> @-@I was deeply involved in being part of the Clinton team,@-@ she said at a recent debate, in response to a question about foreign policy. </s> <s> @-@ Vowing to be a pragmatic, bipartisan president, she signed on to lead an initiative with the D. L. C. and welcomed the endorsement of such figures as Robert Rubin, the Clinton Treasury secretary whose push for deficit reduction in the early @-@90s has made him a lasting figure of revulsion for anti-corporate liberals. </s> <s> Despite intense pressure from John Edwards and Barack Obama, she publicly refused to swear off donations from industry lobbyists, and she spoke out in favor of a House vote to approve a new free-trade agreement with Peru. </s> <s> At the YouTube@-@CNN debate in July, she pointedly refused to describe herself as a liberal. </s> <s> When Clinton, alone among the party@-@s presidential hopefuls, voted in September for a Senate resolution labeling the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist group, a resolution the other Democrats charged would empower Bush to pursue yet another military strike, it looked to a lot of Democrats like an all-too-familiar Clintonian dash toward the center. </s> <s> Clinton seemed to be feeling secure as the front-runner and already looking ahead to the general election, where she planned to occupy the same moderate space her husband had. </s> <s> By then, though, voters in Iowa and New Hampshire had begun to pay closer attention to the race, and the attacks on Clintonism were beginning to resonate. </s> <s> There are at least three different angles from which Edwards and Obama have tried, often subtly, to trash Clintonism without criticizing the former president himself. </s> <s> The first might be called the triangulation story line. </s> <s> Edwards unsheathed the word like a poison-tipped arrow at the same YouTube debate where Hillary Clinton declined to be called a liberal. </s> <s> @-@Do you believe that compromise, triangulation, will bring about big change? </s> <s> @-@ he asked the audience. </s> <s> @-@I don@-@t.@-@ Thwang. </s> <s> Since then, Edwards has at every opportunity tried to encourage liberal voters in their view that the Clinton era was a time of craven calculation and surrender to the conservative movement. </s> <s> In October, after Clinton was asked in a debate if she supported a New York State plan to give driver@-@s licenses to illegal immigrants @-@ and after she tried to twist her way out of answering with such tenacity that she nearly invented a new yoga position @-@ the Edwards campaign released a video titled @-@The Politics of Parsing,@-@ which showed Clinton contradicting herself on other issues too. </s> <s> The subtext was clear: Do you really want to go through all that again?Obama, who once vowed to adhere to the @-@new politics@-@ of genial campaigning, has picked up on this same triangulation theme with evident enthusiasm in recent months. </s> <s> In Spartanburg, S. C., last month, he said that Clinton had been running a @-@textbook@-@ campaign @-@ whose textbook wasn@-@t hard to discern @-@ that @-@encourages vague, calculated answers to suit the politics of the moment, instead of clear, consistent principles about how you would lead America. </s> <s> @-@ Later in the month, at a dinner for leading Iowa Democrats, Obama used the dreaded epithet itself. </s> <s> @-@Triangulating and poll-driven positions because we@-@re worried about what Mitt or Rudy might say about us just won@-@t do,@-@ he said, as Hillary Clinton sat a few feet away. </s> <s> The second narrative aimed at the Clinton years, pursued mostly by Edwards, is the one about corporate corruption. </s> <s> This one argues that Bill Clinton turned the Democratic Party into a holding company for Wall Street financiers, pursuing a series of economic policies that were bad for workers but kept the party flush with cash. </s> <s> By this theory, balanced budgets and free trade were more about winning elections at any cost than they were about creating an expansive economy, and they led directly to the Bush epoch and its alarming inequality. </s> <s> This is why Edwards spent weeks hammering at Clinton over her continued acceptance of lobbyists@-@ money @-@despite his own reliance on donations from trial lawyers, who do plenty of lobbying themselves@-@. </s> <s> The point was to remind voters that when Bill Clinton rented out the Lincoln Bedroom, Hillary was sleeping down the hall. </s> <s> Obama, meanwhile, has been going after the Clinton legacy with a third story line: Boomer fatigue. </s> <s> Never mind whether Bill Clinton or Newt Gingrich was to blame, Obama says @-@ the point is that the two parties had each other in a death grip throughout the @-@90s, and vital business went unfinished as a result. </s> <s> If you really want things to stay that way, he says, then vote for another Clinton and watch these self-obsessed baby boomers go at it all over again. </s> <s> When Obama leaned on Hillary Clinton for not pushing to declassify all of her papers from the Clinton White House, he was offering voters a reminder of all the lawyers and investigations, the missing billing records, the constant subpoenas for cabinet members that never seemed to go away. </s> <s> @-@You have to be careful to be honest, and being honest means giving President Clinton his full due,@-@ David Axelrod, Obama@-@s main strategist, told me not long ago. </s> <s> @-@I don@-@t think Obama is arguing that Bill Clinton is a bad person or a bad president, or that Hillary Clinton is a bad person or a bad senator. </s> <s> That@-@s not what we@-@re saying. </s> <s> We@-@re saying that we have to move forward and get beyond these old battles. </s> <s> @-@By taking on the Clinton legacy through imagery and innuendo, Hillary@-@s rivals seem to have brought to the surface feelings of profound ambivalence, among many voters, about what that era really meant. </s> <s> She still holds a substantial lead in national polling, but in Iowa a flurry of recent polls have shown Clinton tied with Obama, and her lead among women there @-@ a critical piece of her formula for victory @-@ has eroded precipitously. </s> <s> According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll earlier this month, only half the voters thought Clinton was @-@willing enough@-@ to say what she @-@really thinks about the issues,@-@ compared with three-quarters for her two main rivals. </s> <s> Perhaps more troubling for the Clinton camp, the race in New Hampshire, where the Clintons are essentially family, appeared to have tightened considerably. </s> <s> While polls from New Hampshire have varied widely, making their reliability something of a guessing game, a poll jointly conducted a few weeks ago by WMUR in Manchester and CNN found that Clinton@-@s 20-point lead there had completely evaporated. </s> <s> Clinton@-@s aides described all this as the inevitable dynamic of a race in its later stages, when voters really focus on their choices for the first time. </s> <s> But as Iowa edges closer, their campaign has seemed on the edge of panic. </s> <s> Earlier this month, Clinton, who had always tried to appear vaguely amused at her opponents@-@ antics, started flailing away at Obama. </s> <s> First she assailed him for saying he hadn@-@t always wanted to be president when, in fact, he wrote an essay in kindergarten saying that he did intend to one day occupy the Oval Office. </s> <s> @-@She shrewdly left out the fact that every other 5-year-old in America says the exact same thing. </s> <s> @-@ On that same day, Wolfson, her communications director, appearing on @-@Face the Nation,@-@ charged that Obama had been operating a @-@slush fund@-@ through his political action committee. </s> <s> Then one of Clinton@-@s national campaign co-chairmen in New Hampshire pointedly suggested that Obama, who has admitted to using drugs when he was younger, would be vulnerable, as the nominee, to questions about whether he gave drugs to others or even sold them. </s> <s> That was too much for the candidate herself, who felt compelled to apologize personally. </s> <s> For his part, Bill Clinton has tried to restrain himself. </s> <s> In his later years, the Big Dog, as bloggers sometimes refer to him, has transcended politics and even ordinary celebrity; like Paul McCartney or Muhammad Ali, Clinton is now a historical figure who remains a breathing, walking presence, and when he enters a room of strangers, even those who didn@-@t vote for him react as if

final days before voting begins, neither Mr. Romney nor Mr. Edwards is emphasizing his own finances, for obvious political reasons. </s> <s> Instead, the two candidates talk about the work that led to their wealth. </s> <s> Mr. Romney speaks about his managerial skills and notes that not one of the leading Democrats has ever run a large organization. </s> <s> Mr. Edwards talks about his record as a

growth in this country. </s> <s> It@-@s good to be with a group that cares about growth. </s> <s> Everybody likes growth, but liberals just assume it. </s> <s> They just imagine that growth has always been around, and it will always be around. </s> <s> They somehow feel it@-@s like air. </s> <s> It@-@s just there. </s> <s> We@-@ve out competed everybody else in the world, and if we just keep on doing what we@-@re doing, somehow we@-@ll always be growing very quickly. </s> <s> @-@I actually found in my private sector life that there are factors which enhance growth and there are factors which retard growth. </s> <s> I spent, as Pat indicated, 25 years in business, 10 years consulting to by and large, large corporations to find ways to help them transform their business. </s> <s> And then I spent 15 years in the venture capital business. </s> <s> Venture capital really is the nexus between risk capital and innovation. </s> <s> It@-@s the place where new jobs start. </s> <s> @-@And I also spent 15 years in Bain Capital, and in not just venture capital, but in what is known as private equity. </s> <s> And some of you are familiar with private equity. </s> <s> This is where you buy somebody else@-@s company and you try and make it better. </s> <s> It@-@s highly improbable, that, I mean you think about this, you@-@re going to go out, I remember doing this, we bought a company from Tom Monahan, he lives here in this area. </s> <s> Tom Monahan, he founded Domino@-@s pizza. </s> <s> He opened the first store. </s> <s> He decided at a certain date a few years ago that that was the exact best time to sell, and he hired a firm to hawk it to everybody in the country. </s> <s> @-@We were the poor schlemiels that paid more than anybody else. </s> <s> And it was up to us to find a way to make more money making pizza than the guy who had done it for 50 years had done. </s> <s> And yet we did that. </s> <s> It@-@s remarkable in America, there is an approach to changing organizations to make them better and better and better, and that@-@s what we were able to do. </s> <s> So, in private equity, we@-@re at this juncture of again, risk capital, but also the transforming power that you see in the private sector. </s> <s> @-@Now, it@-@s hard to blame the liberals too much for the fact that they think growth is going to happen automatically because it has been around ever since Ronald Reagan has been around. </s> <s> We@-@ve seen pretty good growth. </s> <s> There@-@s been some ups and downs, but our economy has grown well. </s> <s> And they somehow just assume it will always be there. </s> <s> But if they@-@d paid more attention to what has been going on around the world, they@-@d say, @-@Actually, there are factors that do influence growth, and either retard it or accelerate it. </s> <s> @-@And if they had looked at the Soviet Union they would have seen for instance that if you blockade yourself from world trade, outside of your national

same number: about 4,700 a year. </s> <s> Today we@-@ve dropped to 4,400 a year, they@-@ve gone to 24,900. </s> <s> They@-@re investing in brain power and in technology. </s> <s> New chemical plants, 120 of them have been announced with over a billion in capital over the next decade @-@ 120 plants, 50 in China. </s> <s> How many in this country? </s> <s> One. </s> <s> So we face a tougher competitive array as a result of the emergence of Asia. </s> <s> @-@Second challenge, our entitlement challenge and the baby boom combining with the entitlement challenge has presented us with, well the potential for America to follow the track of Europe and to become a welfare state. </s> <s> We@-@ll talk about that some more. </s> <s> @-@We@-@re overusing foreign oil. </s> <s> It doesn@-@t make sense to me to take a billion dollars a day and send it to other economies, other than our own, when we could be keeping it here. </s> <s> Particularly when the people we send it to include Ahmadinejad and Putin, and Chavez and the like. </s> <s> @-@And then there@-@s another issue that is, I won@-@t spend a lot of time on, but it@-@s the cultural challenge that we face in this new generation of challenges. </s> <s> And culture sounds awfully soft. </s> <s> It doesn@-@t fall into the same category as the emergence of Asia, overspending on oil, or the emergence of an entitlement mentality that leads to a welfare state. </s> <s> But actually, I@-@m very concerned about culture. </s> <s> @-@America@-@s culture, I@-@m convinced, is what has allowed us to lead the world. </s> <s> It led to that. </s> <s> There@-@s a great book by, I@-@m sure he@-@s a liberal, I don@-@t know that, but he@-@s a professor at Harvard so I presume it. </s> <s> And his name is David Landes, it@-@s a book called, The Wealth and Poverty of Nations, and it had on the cover, an endorsement by John Kenneth Galbraith so I had to swallow hard before I picked it up. </s> <s> I started reading it, and I found it a pretty scholarly approach to looking at why nations come and go, why civilizations are strong or weak. </s> <s> And after about 500 pages of analysis, he said, approximately these words, @-@If you can learn anything from the history of the economic development of the world it is this: culture makes all the difference. </s> <s> @-@ Culture. </s> <s> @-@And I thought about our culture in America. </s> <s> We love hard work. </s> <s> We take risks. </s> <s> We like opportunity more than we like dependence and ease. </s> <s> Americans, by and large, believe in something greater than themselves. </s> <s> Most Americans believe in God. </s> <s> We believe in our families. </s> <s> We@-@re a family oriented people. </s> <s> Because we believe in God and in families, we@-@re willing to sacrifice now for rewards down the road for our kids and for our grandkids. </s> <s> Americans love freedom. </s> <s> These kinds of cultural elements are what, in my view, have propelled us to become the superpower of the world. </s> <s> @-@And all of them are under attack. </s> <s> A whole generation of people in some of our cities who don@-@t understand the nature of work, who don@-@t value education, we have an attack on the family. </s> <s> Over, among our African-American population, one of the tragedies, 68@-@ of kids being born to a single parent and the Hispanic population growing closer to that number everyday. </s> <s> Kids deserve moms and dads. </s> <s> We need to bring moms and dads into the home if we are going to continue to have the culture that@-@s led us to be so, so strong. </s> <s> @-@So we@-@re being challenged in new ways and unless we change, and that is of course what the private sector does all the time, corporations change all the time, even if they are highly successful they change to get even better. </s> <s> I was with the CEO of Goldman Sachs, we had a great lunch this week, or breakfast this week, and he took over after Hank Paulson. </s> <s> Think about that. </s> <s> I wouldn@-@t want to take over after Hank Paulson. </s> <s> A company at the very top of it@-@s game making more money than ever. </s> <s> He came in and what did he do? </s> <s> He changed everything. </s> <s> And it@-@s even more profitable. </s> <s> @-@That@-@s what you find in America: innovation, transformation, change. </s> <s> In government, we face a changing world and yet things almost never change at all. </s> <s> We@-@re organized almost the same as we were when Abraham Lincoln was President. </s> <s> And it@-@s time for us to recognize that America@-@s government needs also to change. </s> <s> The innovation that we see in the private sector needs to become part of the governmental sector. </s> <s> The transformation that we see day-in and day-out needs to become part of the governmental sector as well. </s> <s> @-@Well, let@-@s begin by talking about our objectives. </s> <s> James Carville coined the phrase, @-@It@-@s the economy, stupid. </s> <s> @-@ And I didn@-@t like the stupid part, but the economy part made some sense to me. </s> <s> But somehow the word economy connotes the idea of short term. </s> <s> You know, if you@-@re in a recession, let@-@s just get the economy up and everything will be good. </s> <s> I think we might be better to say, @-@It@-@s growth, stupid. </s> <s> @-@ Growth means higher incomes. </s> <s> Growth means more wealth. </s> <s> Growth means U. S. leadership. </s> <s> And this is what I@-@d tell to our friend James Carville, @-@It is growth, stupid. </s> <s> @-@And I@-@m, I@-@m convinced that the liberals value growth, but they don@-@t understand that it@-@s highly vulnerable. </s> <s> And the things that are done at the governmental level affect our ability to grow as a nation. </s> <s> It flows in some respect I think to the views the liberals have, and I apologize to the liberals in the audience, is there one here? </s> <s> OK, I@-@m safe. </s> <s> It has to do with their view of the world. </s> <s> And I think John Edwards blurted out the truth, in his own mind, he blurted out what the liberals think is the truth. </s> <s> And he characterized America this way, he said, @-@There are two Americas. </s> <s> @-@ In his view, it@-@s the rich and the rest. </s> <s> And the Democrats have a wonderful way of dividing the rich between the 1@-@ and there@-@s the 99@-@. </s> <s> And for them, given this characterization of the world, by the way the boxes around the dollars sign and the cent sign indicate their view of growth, for them there is no growing the amount of money, it@-@s just a static amount. </s> <s> And therefore policy for them is relatively simple. </s> <s> Governmental policy, all you have to do is this: just take money from the rich and give it to the rest and you have accomplished the work of government. </s> <s> @-@Now, I don@-@t see that. </s> <s> My life in the private sector working with corporations and starting corporations and working also in the voluntary sector taught me that there@-@s a very different perspective of America. </s> <s> And very simply it is this, that the American people are the source of our strength. </s> <s> And the American people, their ideas, their passion, their hard work, their education, their love of freedom, their love of country, their love of the future, their willingness to sacrifice. </s> <s> The American people are what lead to the vibrant and growing economy that we have, and the extraordinary growth of our economy and the wealth of our corporations generate returns which in turn incentivize the American people to do even more, and to come up with more ideas and to invest more. </s> <s> @-@It@-@s a little more complicated than that. </s> <s> I add a couple of things here. </s> <s> I@-@ve separated the American people their ideas if you will, their thinking, and their brain power, their muscle power, and their capital. </s> <s> The capital that goes for investment, they take their money and they invest it and that creates the growing thriving enterprises and the high personal incomes. </s> <s> Then you@-@ll note that there@-@s an arrow, there is a button on here for a laser, I was in consulting for a lot of years and I never had a laser button. </s> <s> Look at that, there@-@s a laser button, that little arrow, this is so silly. </s> <s> @-@But that little arrow there, that@-@s corporate profits. </s> <s> Democrats fundamentally believe that corporate profit is a bad thing, that it indicates something is wrong. </s> <s> They like knowing a company is profitable, but oh, oh so barely profitable. </s> <s> Because, if it is profitable that all of the people will keep their jobs. </s> <s> But, they don@-@t recognize what profit is. </s> <s> I know there@-@s a little profit that goes into the bonuses for executives, it@-@s a tiny share. </s> <s> And there are a lot of people who feel that sometimes those bonuses are out of alignment. </s> <s> But that@-@s not where most American profit goes. </s> <s> The great majority of America profit, 95, 98, 99@-@ of it goes to growth. </s> <s> It goes to working capital necessary for growth. </s> <s> It goes for capital investment, capital expenditures for plants and equipment and so forth. </s> <s> It goes to research and development, that@-@s where corporate profits go, so it cycles back and then of course it comes back in. </s> <s> @-@And the American people, given their high personal incomes, oh this is fun, they get that, that money goes back up to them, and then of course they turn around and put it back down. </s> <s> It@-@s a wonderful machine, and that machine is what has propelled America@-@s growth and has allowed us to eclipse virtually every other country in the world, every other country in the world. </s> <s> @-@Now, one thing that my little model here doesn@-@t show is that there are also some retarding factors, some brakes on growth, it would be great if it worked just like that alone. </s> <s> But there are some things that slow down growth, and I@-@ve put them down here, braking and slowing factors. </s> <s> Taxes is one of them, inefficient elements of our economy where money goes where it is not being used effectively, slows it down. </s> <s> Abuse, of course, fraud, abuse slows it down. </s> <s> @-@Let@-@s look at taxes first. </s> <s> Anytime there@-@s bureaucracy, inefficiency, or pork you are just pouring money down the drain, its money that could go into investment in new technology, working capital, capital expenditures, and growth. </s> <s> Taxes and runaway taxes and runaway spending just slow down growth. </s> <s> Entitlements are in some respects a show of compassion. </s> <s> As long as they@-@re reasonable and sustainable, they@-@re great. </s> <s> But if they become unreasonable and unsustainable they can kill growth of a nation. </s> <s> @-@And then, of course, military. </s> <s> Look, you can@-@t possibly have an engine that@-@s growing if people don@-@t know whether they will be there to receive the rewards of their investment. </s> <s> You have to have safety and security and because there are bad people in the world you@-@ve got to have a military and a strong military. </s> <s> I happen to think that we@-@ve under-invested in the Clinton years and since in our military. </s> <s> I think we need to re-invest in our military. </s> <s> But with the exception of military there, those taxes that slows us down. </s> <s> Then there are the inefficient sectors of our economy. </s> <s> @-@Regulations, over regulation, things like Sarbanes-Oxley. </s> <s> Let@-@s apply millions of dollars of penalty to every company in America thinking about being public. </s> <s> That slows down growth. </s> <s> Tort claims, excessive tort claims. </s> <s> Look, normal application of the legal process is essential and necessary for an effective economy. </s> <s> But excessive tort claims and runaway liability rewards retard the growth of our entire economy and slow down the success that all of our citizens enjoy. </s> <s> @-@Health care, I mention health care, not because there@-@s something wrong it, but because it@-@s one of the sectors of our economy that is not terribly productive. </s> <s> Every country it seems has an unproductive sector. </s> <s> The Europeans and the Asians typically the unproductive sectors are agriculture and retail. </s> <s> In our country, the most unproductive, I think, of the major sectors, now at 17 percent of GDP, is health care. </s> <s> It@-@s a very inefficient sector of our economy. </s> <s> It@-@s poised, it@-@s poised to change and become an extraordinarily successful part of our economy if we apply market dynamics to it. </s> <s> But, if instead, if we apply Hillary-care to it, it@-@ll become worse than ever imagined. </s> <s> I love what P. J. O@-@Rourke said, he said, @-@If you think health care is expensive now, wait until it@-@s free. </s> <s> @-@ And we@-@ve got to make sure she doesn@-@t get her hands on health care. </s> <s> @-@Of course you recognize that there are areas of abuse and they drain money which otherwise could go into this great machine that creates higher incomes, higher wealth for our citizens, greater security for all of us. </s> <s> Now, by the way, if you look at that list down there and you think about where the Democrats line up, I mean they@-@re not going to cut taxes, they@-@re going to increase taxes if they have their way, they want to reverse tax cuts. </s> <s> When you look at the inefficient, they want to increase regulations, they want to protect the tort industry, and they want to have government take over health care making it even more inefficient. </s> <s> So basically what the Democrats would do, would be to apply all of their strength behind the brakes. </s> <s> And the effect would be to dramatically slow down the economy of this great country. </s> <s> @-@Now we Republicans, I@-@m afraid, haven@-@t done as well as I would have liked us to over this last six-year period. </s> <s> Yeah, I@-@m getting a little smiling there, a little laughter, I hear an amen. </s> <s> This happens to show the domestic discretionary spending of the last, how many years here? </s> <s> Look about the last 15 or 20 years. </s> <s> And this is not actual, this is what it would have been, if beginning in 1998, excuse me, if beginning in the year, I think it@-@s, 2000, we would have only spent, based upon inflation, or kept up with inflation, plus the additional money in homeland security. </s> <s> There@-@s the bump for homeland security. </s> <s> There@-@s what we actually spent. </s> <s> There@-@s how much more we spent than inflation plus the homeland security dollars. </s> <s> We spent dramatically more in discretionary accounts than inflation plus homeland security. </s> <s> At the end point there in 2006, it@-@s @-@113 billion more than inflation would have taken us. </s> <s> This is our record as Republicans and no wonder members of our base are very upset and wondering what Republicans stand for, because in my view, that@-@s just unacceptable. </s> <s> @-@Now, it@-@s hard to stop, I know how hard to stop it is. </s> <s> I was Governor of a state with a legislature that was 85@-@ Democrat, and that makes it tough. </s> <s> I came in and we had a huge budget gap. </s> <s> I thought it was going to be a billion dollar budget gap. </s> <s> It turned out to be a @-@3 billion budget gap. </s> <s> About 85@-@ of that I was able to solve by cutting back on the scale of government. </s> <s> We eliminated agencies. </s> <s> We eliminated departments. </s> <s> We had three highway departments @-@ we had one for the turnpike, one for the highways around the city, and then one for all of the other highways. </s> <s> Why do you have three highway departments? </s> <s> I put them together. </s> <s> It took four years to get the last one closed down. </s> <s> @-@Then we have two parks departments. </s> <s> We have islands in the harbor in Boston, as you probably know. </s> <s> Some of the islands are managed by one park department. </s> <s> Some are managed by another parks department, all with their own boats and their personnel and their IT people and so forth. </s> <s> So we collapsed them and put them together. </s> <s> I got rid of agencies. </s> <s> @-@One of the commentators in town said that I did not just go after the sacred cows, I@-@d gone after the whole herd. </s> <s> I was pleased with the fact that every single year we balanced the budget and actually we re-stocked the rainy day fund, we drew it down to about @-@600 million, we got it back up to @-@2 billion. </s> <s> And we made some progress there. </s> <s> Not everything was exactly as I@-@d have liked it, but we were able to cut back on the scale of government. </s> <s> @-@By the way, I@-@m proud of the fact that when my term was over, we went back and added up all of our state employees. </s> <s> I had added a lot of employees in public safety. </s> <s> We had a crime lab that was behind the times. </s> <s> A DNA lab that didn@-@t have enough personnel. </s> <s> I added substantial new classes to our state troopers. </s> <s> I wanted to have the people safe. </s> <s> But when it was all over, we had actually reduced jobs in state workers. </s> <s> We had fewer state workers than when I got elected. </s> <s> I wish that happened more in this country. </s> <s> @-@I have to tell you, I can@-@t wait to get my hands on Washington D. C. I am delighted at the prospect of being able to get in there because it@-@s what I do. </s> <s> What I@-@ve done throughout my business career is going into corporations and find ways to scale back overhead, scale back the unnecessary and the wasteful, pull back that which is unproductive so you can do more of what is productive. </s> <s> And so I know how to cut things back without hurting them. </s> <s> And then I went to the Olympics and I got out there and we had about a @-@1.3 billion budget and I said that was too much. </s> <s> I cut the budget by @-@200 million @-@ that was not easy @-@ and we put on great games. </s> <s> My guess is we could have saved even more. </s> <s> We ended up with a @-@100 million profit at the end which I was pleased to report as well. </s> <s> It@-@s exactly what I did in business, it@-@s what I@-@ve done in the Olympics, it@-@s what I@-@ve done in state government which is learn how to cut back. </s> <s> @-@Government is simply too big. </s> <s> State government is too big. </s> <s> The federal government is too big. </s> <s> It@-@s spending too much. </s> <s> There@-@s a lot we can do with efficiency and duplication. </s> <s> There@-@s even more we can do by just simply cutting back on the scale of our government. </s> <s> @-@Now there@-@s something else I@-@ve proposed. </s> <s> I was proud to sign Grover Norquist@-@s tax pledge. </s> <s> But I also put in place, I also announced that I@-@m signing another pledge and that is a spending pledge. </s> <s> You see that chart there? </s> <s> What I@-@ve said is domestic discretionary spending I will cap at inflation less one percent @-@ so one percent less than inflation. </s> <s> And if I get spending appropriations @-@ there@-@s some 13 appropriation bills @-@ if I get those bills on my desk and they@-@re greater than that amount, I will veto them. </s> <s> @-@And I like vetoes. </s> <s> I vetoed a lot of things and we@-@ve got to have that happen. </s> <s> You know, people used to say to me in Massachusetts, @-@Governor, you@-@ve had a lot of vetoes and a lot of them get overridden. </s> <s> Most of them get overridden. </s> <s> That weakens your power. </s> <s> @-@ I said, @-@Baloney. </s> <s> I want people to know what I stand for. </s> <s> And I@-@m going to veto items even if that 85@-@ legislature goes out and spends it, I@-@m going to veto it to make sure people know what is right and what is wrong for the leadership in our state. </s> <s> @-@Now, I@-@m going to turn to another area and that@-@s discretionary spending. </s> <s> Let@-@s talk about entitlements and I know this is the third rail, as they say. </s> <s> And no one should talk about entitlements. </s> <s> No one who@-@s thinking about running for president should talk about entitlements. </s> <s> Well, it@-@s time we talk about entitlements. </s> <s> It@-@s too important. </s> <s> We@-@ve got to deal with it honestly. </s> <s> We@-@ve got to make sure that America understands that if we don@-@t deal with entitlements honestly, then we could turn America into Europe. </s> <s> We could become the France of the 21st century. </s> <s> Yeah, having begun as the superpower and end up as something less than that. </s> <s> @-@Let me show you, this is from the CBO, published in December of 2005. </s> <s> It@-@s based on, I believe about a two and a half or two and three quarter percent GDP growth rate. </s> <s> So it@-@s sort of a midpoint in the growth rates. </s> <s> The squiggly line at the top shows tax revenues as a percentage of GDP over the last 40 years. </s> <s> You can see they bounce up and down, but pretty much stay within sort of the 18 to 19 percent range. </s> <s> Interesting, isn@-@t it, by the way. </s> <s> You see John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan recognized that you could lower tax rates, lower marginal tax rates and government, because of the growth of the economy, government still gets the money it needs. </s> <s> You keep lowering tax rates, you get more growth and you get, therefore, the money government needs. </s> <s> And so, that number bounces around a little bit, but overall, the government@-@s getting the money it needs. </s> <s> Now that@-@s right around 18@-@. </s> <s> @-@Well, you see what@-@s happening down below. </s> <s> You see what happens to Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. </s> <s> Basically, left unattended, and assuming about a two and a half percent growth rate of the GDP, you get to a point where entitlements end up eating the entire federal budget. </s> <s> @-@Now that, obviously, that can@-@t be allowed to happen and it suggests a couple of things. </s> <s> One is, and most importantly, how can you grow the economy faster? </s> <s> And what tax policies will allow us to grow the economy faster so that we@-@re able to keep ahead of that growth in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security? </s> <s> I@-@ll come to that in a minute @-@ tax policy. </s> <s> Then the other question is, isn@-@t there something we need to do on Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare to rein them in? </s> <s> I think there is. </s> <s> @-@Let me talk about Social Security first. </s> <s> I want to make a key point. </s> <s> We@-@re talking about the program of Social Security for young people @-@ that means folks younger than me. </s> <s> It doesn@-@t mean for retired people or people about to retire, we@-@re talking about people who are in their 30s and 40s. </s> <s> @-@The options that are discussed for reforming Social Security typically begin with the Democrats talking about raising taxes @-@ that@-@s a bad idea. </s> <s> Raising taxes will slow down the economy and become a self-defeating factor because you slow the economy and that makes the burden of the Social Security problem even greater. </s> <s> So you can@-@t raise taxes. </s> <s> @-@Number two, people have talked about an inflation rate based upon consumer price index @-@ perhaps some in the room don@-@t recognize this, but for people right now, when you get your Social Security initial benefit, it@-@s not inflated with the price index @-@ it@-@s inflated with a much higher index: the wage index. </s> <s> And if you just change the index from the wage index to the CPI that we@-@re so used to, that we all talk about, that would pretty much solve the problem of our Social Security burden. </s> <s> @-@You could also extend the retirement age and then there are personal accounts and a lot of folks have said, @-@You know, we have a Social Security surplus right now. </s> <s> Why are we using that money to fund the government? </s> <s> Why don@-@t we allow that money to be used to fund things like personal accounts and there could be other sources for personal accounts as well @-@ voluntary, personal accounts. </s> <s> So we@-@ve got some options there. </s> <s> I want to hear what the Democrats have to say, but it@-@s critical for us to recognize number one on their list is not on our list, and we have to make sure that the others are places that we turn to finally reign in Social Security.@-@Medicaid. </s> <s> I liked what Tommy Thompson did a few years ago. </s> <s> I@-@m not sure you took a close look at that. </s> <s> But he said, @-@Look, why don@-@t we give each state the same money we gave you last year for Medicaid plus about four percent. </s> <s> And then we@-@re also going to give the state the ability to fashion your own program for the poor in the way that you think is the best for your own poor. </s> <s> @-@ Isn@-@t that a great idea? </s> <s> Then every year, you grow the federal spending four percent @-@ a little bit higher than inflation, not the double digit rate its been growing @-@ and the states are able to fashion their own program in a way that meets the needs of their citizens. </s> <s> @-@I just note there, Medicaid is being used by Democrats to creepingly take over health care. </s> <s> It@-@s creeping universal coverage. </s> <s> Because they go out and they say, @-@We have all these people that are uninsured. </s> <s> @-@ And then they run to the federal government and they say, @-@Let@-@s take people who are earning 300@-@ of poverty @-@ three times FPL @-@ and have them get Medicaid. </s> <s> @-@ And we keep on putting more and more people on Medicaid. </s> <s> @-@Medicaid is not a great insurance product. </s> <s> It was designed for the very poor, but it@-@s being used as an insurance product. </s> <s> It has terrible features. </s> <s> It doesn@-@t have people paying any part of their premium. </s> <s> It@-@s entirely free. </s> <s> It also has a cliff eligibility. </s> <s> If your income goes above a certain level, you don@-@t get anything any more. </s> <s> It has all the wrong incentives. </s> <s> So I@-@d like to see us give to the states the flexibility to create their own program based upon personal responsibility, get more people in the program but have them responsible for paying for their own premiums to the extent they possibly can and rein in the spending at the federal level. </s> <s> @-@And then of course, the toughest one, Medicare. </s> <s> And this is the program not for the poor but for the elderly. </s> <s> And I@-@m getting closer to that number every year. </s> <s> I turned 60 this month, and I@-@m thinking about it every day. </s> <s> How do you reform Medicare? </s> <s> I fundamentally think that to rein in Medicare, we@-@re going to have to be serious about reforming health care itself. </s> <s> And I don@-@t see how you@-@re going to reform health care without finally applying market dynamics to health care. </s> <s> @-@It@-@s inexcusable to me that a 17@-@ section of our GDP is not run like a market. </s> <s> When I say not run like a market, people go in to get a treatment @-@ let@-@s say a triple bypass surgery or a colonoscopy @-@ they go to the hospital to get that procedure they know they@-@re going to pay their deductible @-@ @-@500, maybe a thousand @-@ and from then on it@-@s free. </s> <s> So they don@-@t care whether the operation costs @-@100,000 or @-@300,000 because it makes no difference to them. </s> <s> And as long as that@-@s the case, health care will not respond like a market. </s> <s> That@-@s why the health savings accounts are so positive because people do have a stake in how much things cost. </s> <s> @-@And something we instituted in Massachusetts @-@ I sure hope the people who followed me will allow it to happen @-@ is co-insurance @-@ where insurance companies are finally allowed to offer to subscribers a policy which says instead of a deductible, you@-@re responsible for a certain percentage of your bill. </s> <s> Five percent, 10@-@, you choose the number. </s> <s> And now you care whether the surgery is @-@100,000 or @-@50,000 or @-@300,000. </s> <s> And you might go to a hospital four or five miles away further because it has lower costs and just as high a quality. </s> <s> That I think is one of the keys. </s> <s> @-@Tort overhang, there@-@s no question that the tort system that we have and the excessive awards are costing us more in our health care system. </s> <s> And then, of course, there@-@s health care productivity. </s> <s> There@-@s a lot of excitement about information technology, and you@-@ll hear time and again that one third of health care is paperwork. </s> <s> It@-@s not going to disappear. </s> <s> We have a system in Massachusetts that in one of our leading hospital chains @-@ the Partners Health Care chain @-@ is going all electronic. </s> <s> It@-@s terrific, it@-@s saving money, but it@-@s not 30@-@, it@-@s more like 3@-@ and they haven@-@t released the number. </s> <s> But it@-@s not, it@-@s not going to make health care cheap. </s> <s> We have to deal with the market dynamics of health care to make this work. </s> <s> @-@And finally, appropriate care in the appropriate setting. </s> <s> We have to make sure that insurers are allowed to direct people to go to the right clinic, the right doctor and the right hospital. </s> <s> Medicare @-@ we can get there. </s> <s> @-@By the way, I@-@m not a newcomer to this, to health care. </s> <s> I started a health care consulting practice for Bain @-@ Co. We worked with literally dozens of hospitals @-@ I started the, invested in the start-up of a surgical center chain and of course as Governor, as you know, I put in place a health care system. </s> <s> No, it@-@s not perfect. </s> <s> It@-@s about two steps forward. </s> <s> The legislature took one step back. </s> <s> It@-@s our effort to try and make some of these things work in our state. </s> <s> We@-@ll see how well it works. </s> <s> Other states are taking certain parts of what we did, will maybe improve on it. </s> <s> I@-@m sure they will improve on it. </s> <s> But I know one thing. </s> <s> We@-@ve got to show that as conservatives we can get the market to work for health care rather than having the Democrats put in place a Hillary-care-style program that would absolutely sink our economic growth. </s> <s> @-@Let me tell you, spending can be controlled. </s> <s> I know how to do it. </s> <s> I@-@ve done it before. </s> <s> We can control earmarks. </s> <s> We can control pork. </s> <s> We can put a cap on discretionary spending. </s> <s> I want to get in place and do a top-to-bottom review of every agency of government. </s> <s> I love doing that. </s> <s> @-@I don@-@t know how much time you have. </s> <s> One of my favorite stories was getting in as governor and I was cutting every place I found excess. </s> <s> And I was looking at the homeless budget. </s> <s> And my head of finance said, @-@Mitt, you can@-@t look at the homeless budget. </s> <s> We spend @-@130 million a year. </s> <s> You can@-@t cut homeless. </s> <s> @-@ And so I said, @-@Well I want to look at it anyway. </s> <s> @-@ And I went through all the numbers and I got to one number and I mean this is the way it is any one of you would do the same thing. </s> <s> I got to a number and it said @-@hotels. </s> <s> @-@ And I said, @-@What@-@s that? </s> <s> @-@ And he said, @-@Well, if a homeless person presents themself at a shelter and it@-@s full, we put them up in a hotel. </s> <s> @-@ And I said @-@Boy, I bet the word gets around. </s> <s> @-@ And I said, @-@How many hotel rooms a night are we renting in the Boston area? </s> <s> @-@ Boston@-@s expensive. </s> <s> Five hundred ninety-nine rooms a night at the cost of almost @-@30 million, @-@20 plus million in hotel bills. </s> <s> @-@So I said, @-@A simple change of policy is about to be announced. </s> <s> @-@ And that is when someone comes to the shelter and it@-@s full, we welcome them in. </s> <s> But the person who@-@s been there the longest, five, six months they go to the hotel. </s> <s> At the end of year, zero hotel rooms being rented. </s> <s> Zero. </s> <s> And the millions we saved were able to use to help people get on their feet, to get them child care, get them into housing. </s> <s> You can make a dramatic difference by going through and saying, @-@Where can you do a better job? </s> <s> @-@ It@-@s so much fun. </s> <s> It is so much fun. </s> <s> It@-@s hard making companies better because everybody has been doing it before you. </s> <s> It@-@s easy getting government better because it hasn@-@t been done in such a long time. </s> <s> @-@Now let@-@s look at taxes for a minute. </s> <s> Let@-@s look at taxes. </s> <s> This is a squeezed down graph of what I had before. </s> <s> It shows just the tax revenues as a percentage of GDP through 2005 and then it shows what happens if the Bush tax cuts expire. </s> <s> And you@-@ll see that that line just goes absolutely nuts. </s> <s> And the Democrats, of course, want that to happen because think of how much money they can spend on everything they want to spend it on. </s> <s> The red line is what happens if we make the tax cuts permanent. </s> <s> And they@-@re terrified that we@-@re going to make the tax cuts permanent. </s> <s> Well that@-@s the least of what we have to do. </s> <s> @-@Stage one is just to make the tax cuts permanent. </s> <s> Then we have a lot more work to do, as you can see. </s> <s> Or we@-@ll put such a drag on our economy that we can@-@t possibly have the growth that@-@s so essential for our prosperity, for our high wages and salaries and for our leadership of the world. </s> <s> @-@I had some fun by the way in my state. </s> <s> It@-@s hard lowering taxes in Massachusetts as you can imagine. </s> <s> My supreme court did a very unusual thing, the Supreme Judicial Court. </s> <s> I call it mine. </s> <s> I won@-@t do that again. </s> <s> It@-@s the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court did an unusual thing. </s> <s> The legislature had raised capital gains taxes in the middle of the year. </s> <s> And the Court said that was illegal. </s> <s> You have to raise it on January 1st. </s> <s> But they didn@-@t say which January 1st. </s> <s> It could either be a retroactive January 1st or prospective. </s> <s> And this related to a year that had long passed @-@ the 2002 tax year. </s> <s> @-@So my legislature passed a bill saying that there was going to be a @-@250 million tax hike on people for a year that had already passed. </s> <s> And they sent the bill to my desk. </s> <s> Now again, my legislature is 85@-@ Democrat. </s> <s> What was I going to do? </s> <s> Of course, I was going to veto it, but they would override my veto like they do the others. </s> <s> So I went to the Department of Revenue, and I said I want you to run your computer over the weekend and send a tax bill to everybody in the state that@-@s going to owe new tax revenue. </s> <s> Send them their bill. </s> <s> Tell them there has been a bill passed, give them the number of it make it official, Department of Revenue, here@-@s how much money you owe unless this bill is overturned and vetoed by the Governor. </s> <s> Send it out to everybody. </s> <s> And as Everett Dirksen used to say, @-@When they felt the heat, they saw the light. </s> <s> @-@And I sent the bill back to them after people had gotten their bills. </s> <s> I sent the bill back to them with an amendment. </s> <s> My amendment was, instead of a @-@250 million tax increase, there was a @-@250 million tax refund. </s> <s> And they saw the wisdom of my thinking and voted in favor of that. </s> <s> @-@That wasn@-@t the only change. </s> <s> We made the investment tax credit permanent. </s> <s> We put in place sales tax holidays time and again. </s> <s> We put in place this real estate tax advantage program for our seniors. </s> <s> We put in place a manufacturer@-@s tax credit for those that are manufacturing medical products. </s> <s> Every year, I submitted budgets my last three years, I submitted budgets that reduced the income tax rate. </s> <s> They wouldn@-@t do it. </s> <s> I kept on fighting for it. </s> <s> It@-@s time for us to get taxes lower in this country. </s> <s> And we certainly have to begin by making those tax cuts permanent. </s> <s> @-@Let me look at corporate tax for a minute. </s> <s> I don@-@t know whether this will surprise you, but boy it@-@s something that the people in the private sector talk about all the time. </s> <s> Something that we talked when we considered at Bain Capital where we were going to invest, where we would put new property, plant and equipment, where we were going to hire people. </s> <s> The U. S., next to Japan, has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. </s> <s> Well, there may be somebody else higher. </s> <s> I don@-@t know whether Idi Amin got his higher than that in the past. </s> <s> But you will not be surprised to learn that@-@s Ireland. </s> <s> They figured out that if you lower taxes enough, you create growth. </s> <s> And if you create growth, you get more jobs. </s> <s> You get more jobs, more people are paying taxes. </s> <s> You get more taxes paid, the government has more money by charging lower tax rates. </s> <s> And we simply can@-@t afford for our future growth as a country to have a tax rate that is way out of alignment with the other major economies of the world. </s> <s> We@-@re going to have to bring our corporate tax rate into a competitive posture or suffer a slowing and retarding economy by virtue of our willingness to do that. </s> <s> @-@Let me talk just briefly about my tax philosophy. </s> <s> One, I was the first candidate for president to sign the Norquist tax pledge. </s> <s> Of course we have to make the Bush tax cuts permanent. </s> <s> Of course we have to abolish the death tax. </s> <s> It just isn@-@t fair to tax people twice. </s> <s> Well, three times. </s> <s> Once, when they earn it. </s> <s> Second, when they invest it and pay dividends or get their dividends interest and capital gains. </s> <s> And then a third time when they die. </s> <s> @-@Four, I proposed a savings incentive plan. </s> <s> And this is a plan that basically says we@-@re going to let people of moderate income save their interest, their dividends and their capital gains tax free. </s> <s> No tax whatsoever on capital gains, interest and dividends. </s> <s> Lower marginal tax rates for all Americans. </s> <s> Get taxes down. </s> <s> Make them simpler, and flatter and lower. </s> <s> And finally, make our corporate tax competitive with the rest of the world. </s> <s> That@-@s where I@-@m going. </s> <s> That@-@s what I@-@m going to fight for. </s> <s> @-@And I@-@m going to make sure that we get this economy going as fast as it can possibly be going. </s> <s> Because that@-@s the best way to solve our needs. </s> <s> Both our entitlement needs as well as our defense needs and all of our other needs, grow our way to the great vitality and economic strength that we@-@ve always enjoyed. </s> <s> That@-@s exactly by the way, it@-@s hard to say what John F. Kennedy said and what Ronald Reagan said and they were right. </s> <s> They cut more marginal tax rates and by virtue of doing so they got the economy going faster, and we have to keep learning from history and make sure that we do it as soon as we possibly can. </s> <s> @-@Now, Democrats will be singing a very different tune. </s> <s> You@-@re going to hear some very articulate people. </s> <s> I@-@ll tell you, they@-@re pretty well spoken. </s> <s> You know, that Hillary Clinton is probably the least sort of energetic and passionate of the three but Barack Obama and John Edwards @-@ they@-@re remarkable spokespeople. </s> <s> And they@-@re going to be talking about wonderful things they are going to do for the American people. </s> <s> Their siren songs. </s> <s> @-@They@-@re going to talk about raising taxes on just the one percent. </s> <s> And there@-@s no question that they@-@ve said it time and again. </s> <s> They want to stop the Bush tax cuts. </s> <s> They want to repeal them. </s> <s> They want to have them expire in 2011. </s> <s> And short term that will mean higher spending and more money for all their constituents. </s> <s> Long term you know what it means @-@ lower growth, falling incomes for all Americans and rising poverty. </s> <s> It does just the opposite of what they advertise. </s> <s> @-@What@-@s their other siren song? </s> <s> Protectionism. </s> <s> Raise trade barriers. </s> <s> Short term, I think it would mean higher wages. </s> <s> You@-@d have shortages. </s> <s> People would have to pay a lot of money to hire people. </s> <s> There would probably even be more jobs. </s> <s> @-@But long term what happens? </s> <s> Our products would become uncompetitive with the rest of the world. </s> <s> Our Chevrolets would have the same response ten years from now that Yugos had when they were first introduced in our country. </s> <s> Our businesses time after time down the road would collapse, jobs would decline, incomes would fall. </s> <s> Putting up barriers, unless it@-@s against some predatory practice, putting up barriers just kills the economy long term. </s> <s> @-@Another siren song: have the government take over health care. </s> <s> Make sure the people don@-@t have to pay. </s> <s> Boy, it sounds attractive, more health care jobs. </s> <s> I@-@m sure the unions would love it. </s> <s> Health care would seem free to everybody. </s> <s> Don@-@t forget P. J. O@-@Rourke. </s> <s> @-@If you think health care@-@s expensive now, wait until it@-@s free. </s> <s> @-@ Long term what would it mean? </s> <s> Higher taxes, lower investment, business slowdown jobs and income decline. </s> <s> And of course you would end investment in health care innovation by the private sector. </s> <s> @-@And I@-@ve looked at a graph. </s> <s> Have you seen that of where the new innovations and patents come in health care? </s> <s> They all come from the private sector. </s> <s> You basically kill health care investment by virtue of having the government take it over. </s> <s> @-@Another siren song. </s> <s> There are so many of them. </s> <s> Grow unions. </s> <s> Boy this idea of democracy is a real problem for them, as you know. </s> <s> They want to have the card check program where instead of having a private election to determine if a company@-@s going to go union, they want to be able to collect a card from people one by one. </s> <s> You know, show up at your house with fifty or sixty people and say would you sign this card. </s> <s> And then no vote is needed. </s> <s> That@-@s the kind of thing they@-@re trying to do. </s> <s> It would make the union bosses smile of course. </s> <s> And probably raise union wages. </s> <s> But businesses would flee this country, and jobs and income, without question, would decline. </s> <s> @-@And then of course, what are their favorites? </s> <s> Got to protect the tort industry. </s> <s> Got to make sure those windfalls continue to come in. </s> <s> Particularly for the lawyers who bring them, and the free-wheeling judges keep on pouring them money out. </s> <s> It@-@d be a lottery for a few Americans. </s> <s> Americans like lotteries. </s> <s> And it@-@s a great thing to talk about: @-@Boy, you have a shot, if you@-@re lucky enough to get hit by a Greyhound Bus. </s> <s> Why, we could be worth half a billion dollars! </s> <s> @-@Long-term, it@-@s going to make businesses go elsewhere and jobs and income decline @-@ and of course their favorite as well: regulate. </s> <s> Regulate lawyers, regulate developers, regulate innovators, and regulate free speech. </s> <s> @-@What a lousy idea McCain-Feingold is. </s> <s> How about going out at this whole idea that not-for-profits aren@-@t able to speak before an election. </s> <s> I don@-@t know how that passes Constitutional muster. </s> <s> I don@-@t know how it is that we say that we@-@re going to take money out of the campaigns of parties and candidates who can control it and take responsibility for it and we@-@re going to let people like George Soros spend millions and millions @-@ billions I guess if he wants to @-@ trying to influence the direction of this country. </s> <s> It makes no sense at all. </s> <s> Of course, it@-@s great TV. </s> <s> It@-@s great politics. </s> <s> But it@-@s lousy for the economy. </s> <s> It burdens our employers, slows our growth, and causes incomes to decline. </s> <s> @-@Let me just tell you my priorities. </s> <s> We@-@ve got to grow the economy, add good jobs, raise incomes, and preserve our strength. </s> <s> Rein in spending, reform entitlements and cut taxes: death tax, savings tax, corporate tax, marginal taxes. </s> <s> We@-@ve got to promote trade, bring market forces to health care. </s> <s> @-@I want to see federal tort and liability reform, by the way. </s> <s> There@-@s this wonderful ploy. </s> <s> I met with a tort lawyer. </s> <s> He said, @-@Governor Romney, we@-@re talking to some of your Republican counterparts and they agree with us that tort reform should only be done at the state level. </s> <s> @-@ I know what that means. </s> <s> As long as they@-@ve got a couple state legislatures they can count on, they can sue America@-@s corporations in one or two states, and they can always have their windfalls. </s> <s> Now, you have to have Federal Tort Reform. </s> <s> @-@Eliminate excessive regulations and of course, one I@-@ll never forget, which is strengthen American families. </s> <s> We need to have kids that have the skills and abilities to lead the world. </s> <s> @-@Strength, strength is really the heart of the American experience, the American success story. </s> <s> Strength is the heart of the Republican Party. </s> <s> Strength is the fundamental principle of conservatism. </s> <s> Strength in our homes; strong economy, strong growth, strong military, America stands for strength. </s> <s> And strength doesn@-@t just happen. </s> <s> It happens by virtue of good decisions made by good people. </s> <s> @-@I@-@m in the campaign here to make a difference in this country. </s> <s> I@-@ve brought change to every institution I@-@ve touched. </s> <s> I@-@m going to work like crazy to go to Washington and bring change there. </s> <s> I@-@m going to get our economy growing faster. </s> <s> I@-@m going to cut spending. </s> <s> I@-@m going to cut taxes. </s> <s> I@-@m going to work at it every single day, because I know how to do it. </s> <s> I@-@ve done it before. </s> <s> I don@-@t do it alone. </s> <s> I do it by bringing great people to come work with me. </s> <s> I need your help. </s> <s> I@-@d love your endorsement @-@ I@-@d love your money! </s> <s> @-@We@-@ve got a lot of work to do, but we@-@ve got the opportunity of a lifetime. </s> <s> Some people when they see those challenges that I@-@ve put up on the board @-@ all those challenges @-@ they get discouraged. </s> <s> Democrats wring their hands with all the problems we have. </s> <s> I get excited about it. </s> <s> Because the challenges mean we can do something. </s> <s> We can have an opportunity to really make a change in this country. </s> <s> To make sure that the future is brighter for our kids and our grandkids@-@even than it was for us. </s> <s> @-@I@-@m often asked, @-@Why are you running for President?

</s> <s> You are. </s> <s> You@-@re paying right now for those 45 million people, and I had about half a million of them in my state. </s> <s> So I said, @-@Lets see who they are. </s> <s> Are they all poor? </s> <s> @-@ It costs, by the way, our state and federal government and insurers about @-@1.3 billion a year, giving money to hospitals so they can stay in business and not go bankrupt who are giving out free care to people who didn@-@t have insurance. </s> <s> @-@So we went out to look at these people to see who they were. </s> <s> We assumed that they were all going to be poor. </s> <s> What we found out was, was that one quarter of them was making @-@75,000 a year or more. </s> <s> Another quarter were making @-@54,000 a year or more. </s> <s> So half, almost, almost half of the people without insurance could afford to buy it. </s> <s> But they weren@-@t buying it. </s> <s> So we talked to them and said, @-@Why aren@-@t you buying insurance? </s> <s> @-@ And they said, @-@Well why should we? </s> <s> Because if we get sick we go to the hospital and they give it to us for free. </s> <s> @-@ said, @-@Well that doesn@-@t make a lot of sense. </s> <s> @-@ And they said, @-@Well, it@-@s also a bad deal. </s> <s> It costs @-@350 a month for an insurance policy for one person. </s> <s> @-@ That@-@s for a sole proprietor or somebody who@-@s not part of a big corporation. </s> <s> @-@So we went to one of the insurance companies and we said, @-@Why@-@s it so expensive? </s> <s> @-@ And they said, @-@Well, the only people who buy insurance that aren@-@t part of a big corporation or a small company that provides it for them for free, are people who are sick. </s> <s> And so it@-@s real expensive. </s> <s> @-@ We said, @-@Well what would we have to do to get the premiums down to @-@200 a month instead of the @-@350? </s> <s> @-@ And they said, @-@Well take off mandates on us that don@-@t allow us to charge big deductibles and don@-@t allow higher co-payments, and don@-@t allow us to tell people which hospitals and clinics they can go to and which ones they can@-@t go to. </s> <s> Take off all those mandates! </s> <s> @-@ And so my bill took off all the mandates. </s> <s> @-@Now, the legislature put a lot back in. </s> <s> But according to The Boston Globe, and I don@-@t know how accurate it is because they@-@re never right about me, so why would they be right about anything else?

surprising even liberal Democrats with his willingness to upend some of Arkansas@-@s more parochial traditions. </s> <s> A review of his record as governor shows that, beginning in 1996, he drove through a series of changes that transformed education and health insurance in Arkansas, achievements that were never tried by most of his predecessors, including Bill Clinton. </s> <s> But he is also remembered in the state for a style of governing that tended to freeze out anyone of any party who disagreed with his plans. </s> <s> He did not, for example, seek Mr. Clinton@-@s conciliatory middle, or try to court skeptical state lawmakers. </s> <s> Though he was considered as persuasive a speechmaker as he had been a pastor, Mr. Huckabee largely kept his own counsel @-@ in politics, ethics and a singular clemency policy that continues to haunt him. </s> <s> Against the political advice of his party and his aides, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of hundreds of convicts, including murderers, sometimes over the heated objections of prosecutors and victims@-@ families. </s> <s> He was cited five times by the state ethics commission for financial improprieties, and unapologetically accepted tens of thousands of dollars worth of clothes and other gifts while he was governor. </s> <s> Republicans in Arkansas, a beleaguered minority, gleefully greeted his ascendancy but wound up embittered, in many cases, over a governor who @-@sided with liberal Democrats,@-@ as one put it. </s> <s> Mr. Huckabee is a son of small-town Arkansas, yet he deeply angered many in his rural constituency, touching the third rail of the state@-@s politics by shutting down money-draining, redundant school districts in the hinterlands. </s> <s> Protesters rallied at the state Capitol, fearful of losing schools, football teams, and age-old identities, but the governor insisted his way was the best and the schools were closed. </s> <s> He proclaimed himself a fiscal conservative, but startled legislators with his proposals to raise taxes @-@ for roads, in 1999, and for schools, prisons and other services three years later. </s> <s> He sought the electoral defeat of Republicans who opposed him, according to some in the party. </s> <s> A constant throughout was his presence at the microphone, the former television preacher delivering his word from the pulpit though hardly mingling in the Capitol@-@s marble halls. </s> <s> @-@He would go out and stump and do his shtick and tell his jokes and charm you,@-@ said State Senator Jimmy Jeffress, a Democrat and critic of the former governor. </s> <s> @-@He has the gift of gab. </s> <s> He@-@s the only person I know, other than Bill Clinton, who can pick up a rock and give you a 10-minute talk on it. </s> <s>

humble background, when they moved into the governor@-@s mansion in a prestigious neighborhood in Little Rock. </s> <s> @-@Dozens of hate-filled letters,@-@ he wrote in his memoir, @-@From Hope to

become a byword in succeeding years, as the governor spoke out angrily when reporters and others questioned the startling stream of gifts that flowed in from supporters and friends. </s> <s> Still, the novice governor found the sea legs in 1997 to help enact, with overwhelming support in the heavily Democratic Legislature, a major expansion of health insurance for children of the working poor whose families did not qualify for Medicaid. </s> <s> It was one of the first such expansions in the nation, coming before the federal government authorized them, and it baffled some Republicans in the Legislature. </s> <s> @-@None of us understood what he was trying to do,@-@ said Peggy Jeffries, then a Republican state senator and now executive director of the Arkansas affiliate of the Eagle Forum, a national group of conservatives. </s> <s> Easily elected to a full term in 1998, Mr. Huckabee was emerging as something of an unquantifiable presence in the state capital, sometimes exerting leadership, other times not, and often floating above the details and minutia of governing. </s> <s> But he confounded Republicans again when he pushed for a fuel tax increase to finance an ambitious road-building program, and eventually won support for what historians say was the largest highway bond program in Arkansas history. </s> <s> Meanwhile, a style of leadership was developing that frustrated Republicans and Democrats alike. </s> <s> Jake Files, a former Republican state representative, recalled that the governor would call lawmakers into his office and state his plans. </s> <s>

presented the newly re-elected governor with the biggest challenge of his tenure, ruling that Arkansas@-@s system of financing public schools was inequitable. </s> <s> The court ordered change. </s> <s> More money had to be found, quickly. </s> <s> Mr. Huckabee immediately adopted the path of greatest resistance, to the shock of many in the Legislature: he called for the closing of dozens of wasteful, tiny school districts. </s> <s> Some had fewer than 150 students. </s> <s> It was a volatile step, one that Mr. Clinton as governor had avoided, even though reformers had agreed for decades that it was an essential one. </s> <s> @-@We certainly didn@-@t want to get too close to it,@-@ recalled one of Mr. Clinton@-@s legislative aides in the 1980s, Bobby Roberts. </s> <s> The governor@-@s plan aroused intense opposition all over the state, particularly as he proposed whittling down the 310 school districts by well over half. </s> <s> @-@People don@-@t want to lose their schools,@-@

and it became law without him. </s> <s> Clemency and ConsequencesNothing was more controversial about Mr. Huckabee@-@s governorship than his use of clemency to grant pardons and commute prison sentences. </s> <s> His clemency decisions produced the first big crisis of his administration, dogged him through a tough re-election campaign and provoked a series of bitter public protests, some still simmering on Jan. 9, 2007, the day he left office. </s> <s> @-@ In all, Mr. Huckabee cut prison sentences or granted pardons for more than 1,000 criminals, far more than either his immediate predecessors or governors in neighboring states. </s> <s> This did not happen by chance. </s> <s> Driven by a religious belief in redemption and questions about the state@-@s legal system, Mr. Huckabee paid close attention to clemency petitions, former aides said. </s> <s> He insisted on reviewing every single application, though they came in by the hundreds most months. </s> <s> @-@He would take these files home with him to the governor@-@s mansion,@-@ recalled Rex Nelson, Mr. Huckabee@-@s communications director for nine years. </s> <s> @-@He would read them, study them. </s> <s> He took it very seriously, the political consequences be damned. </s> <s> @-@@-@ Most of Mr. Huckabee@-@s clemency decisions were unremarkable; in the vast majority of cases he simply followed the recommendation of the Arkansas Parole Board. </s> <s> But in a small though significant number of cases, he commuted prison sentences for murderers and other violent criminals over the pleas of victims@-@ families, prosecutors and judges. </s> <s> And as his reputation for granting clemency spread, applications surged. </s> <s> @-@We had tons of them,@-@ said Cory Cox, who worked for several years as Mr. Huckabee@-@s aide in charge of clemency matters. </s> <s> @-@People, they@-@d call and say, @-@Please, let the governor look at this. </s> <s> We don@-@t know who the next governor is going to be. </s> <s> @-@ @-@@-@ By every account, Mr. Huckabee@-@s approach to clemency was heavily influenced by his religious beliefs. </s> <s> As John Wesley Hall, a Little Rock defense lawyer who filed numerous clemency petitions with the Huckabee administration, put it, @-@He@-@s a Baptist preacher who believes in redemption and second chances. </s> <s> @-@ But it also reflected Mr. Huckabee@-@s broader concerns about the criminal justice system in Arkansas, one of the few states where juries rather than judges impose sentences, which defense lawyers say can produce arbitrary results. </s> <s> Dana Reece, another defense lawyer, told of one client who received a life sentence for selling six grams of crack cocaine. </s> <s> @-@He@-@d still be in prison today if it weren@-@t for Governor Huckabee,@-@ Ms. Reece said. </s> <s> How many politicians, she asked, would stick their necks out for a crack dealer? </s> <s> @-@This was a political hot potato, and he knew it,@-@ Mr. Cox said of his former boss. </s> <s> @-@But he had a conviction that people could better themselves, and he was open-minded to the idea that a poor black man from east Arkansas convicted by an all-white jury just may have been a victim of injustice. </s> <s> @-@Many Arkansans faulted him, however, for refusing to give public explanations for pardons and sentence commutations, and for responding harshly to those who criticized his choices. </s> <s> @-@ @-@He just doesn@-@t want to talk to victims@-@ families,@-@ Elaine Colclasure, co-leader of the Central Arkansas chapter of Parents of Murdered Children, a victims@-@ advocacy group, said in an interview last week. </s> <s> @-@He doesn@-@t want anyone questioning anything he does. </s> <s> And when you do, he bristles. </s> <s> His compassion is for the murderer and any criminal who says he has found Jesus. </s> <s> @-@@-@ Dee McManus Engle, another member of the group, recalled accompanying a murder victim@-@s widow to a scheduled meeting at the governor@-@s office. </s> <s> @-@We stayed there half the day trying to talk with Huckabee,@-@ Ms. Engle said, adding, @-@It was the most important thing in her life, and she was in tears because she could not get to the governor. </s> <s> @-@ Former aides said that while Mr. Huckabee rarely met with victims or their families, he was never dismissive of their concerns. </s> <s> @-@I can tell you we listened to victims,@-@ Mr. Cox said. </s> <s> @-@I mean, it was a no-win situation. </s> <s> The victims, if you granted clemency, it didn@-@t matter how long you listened to them. </s> <s> It just tore them up. </s> <s> @-@ As for Mr. Huckabee@-@s refusal to detail his reasons for granting clemency, Mr. Cox said that was intended to prevent other petitioners from mimicking successful arguments. </s> <s> @-@ Some Arkansas prosecutors argue that Mr. Huckabee@-@s clemency record reveals a dangerous gullibility about human nature, particularly when it comes to claims of religious conversion. </s> <s> It raises, they say, the basic question of judgment, the precise question one of Mr. Huckabee@-@s rivals for the Republican nomination, Mitt Romney, has raised anew in his Iowa campaign. </s> <s> Exhibit A in this critique is the case of Wayne Dumond, a rapist who had been implicated in other violent crimes, including a murder and another rape, when Mr. Huckabee took office in 1996. </s> <s> Mr. Dumond said he found God in prison, and his case was championed by evangelicals and conservative opponents of Bill Clinton, who was a distant relative of one of the rape victims and who refused to grant clemency to Mr. Dumond. </s> <s> Months after being sworn in, Mr. Huckabee announced his intention to cut Mr. Dumond@-@s prison sentence, prompting furious public protests from Mr. Dumond@-@s victim and from prosecutors around the state. </s> <s> @-@We told the governor that Wayne Dumond had a history of rape and murder,@-@ Henry Morgan, then president of the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association, recalled. </s> <s> @-@So the governor knew, or any reasonable person should have known, that releasing him was dangerous. </s> <s> @-@ Mr. Huckabee was not persuaded. </s> <s> @-@He thought the man should be released,@-@ Mr. Nelson, his former communications director, recalled. </s> <s> @-@ As it turned out, Mr. Huckabee did not grant clemency to Mr. Dumond; the state Parole Board released him instead, and several former members of the board have since told reporters that they acted under pressure from Mr. Huckabee, a charge he has repeatedly denied. </s> <s> Even so, Mr. Nelson recalled the moment in 2001 when he and Mr. Huckabee first heard the news that the newly freed Mr. Dumond had been charged with raping and murdering a woman in Missouri. </s> <s> @-@Everybody realized at that point that that would be something used against him politically in the 2002 campaign,@-@ he said @-@ a prediction that turned out to be correct when the issue contributed to a tight re-election race. </s> <s> There were several other cases of convicts who won clemency from Mr. Huckabee and then went on to commit more crimes, including Wade Stewart, whose life sentence for murder was commuted in 2004. </s> <s> Mr. Stewart was arrested this year, charged with carrying a concealed revolver. </s> <s> The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette found that nearly one in 10 who received clemency from Governor Huckabee were later sentenced to prison. </s> <s> Mr. Huckabee eventually did bend, if slightly, to criticism and scrutiny. </s> <s> He proved less willing to grant clemency in his second term, especially for violent offenses. </s> <s> He also agreed to give slightly more information about his reasoning. </s> <s> Yet some prosecutors say that victims@-@ families are now skeptical about life sentences. </s> <s> @-@ @-@They say, @-@You can@-@t guarantee that he@-@ll stay in prison for the rest of his life because the governor can let him out,@-@ said Larry Jegley, Little Rock@-@s longtime prosecuting attorney. </s> <s> @-@People are aware the governor has this power and it has been exercised to let murderers, rapists and home invaders loose, and that@-@s a problem. </s> <s> @-@Gifts and CriticsThroughout his tenure, Mr. Huckabee reacted with outrage and scorn when questions arose over the stream of gifts that flowed his way. </s> <s> He pugnaciously fought back against state ethics commission investigations. </s> <s> The governor appeared to find no conflict between occupying the highest office in the state, and receiving tribute; critics, on the other hand, said the two were directly related, in a way that was unseemly at best. </s> <s> Early in his first term, he was questioned, and eventually sued, for using a state fund meant to operate the governor@-@s mansion for personal family expenses like pantyhose and meals at Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </s> <s> The suit was eventually dropped, but spending out of the fund was curtailed. </s> <s> Meanwhile, other methods emerged to supplement the governor@-@s salary, which was @-@68,448 in 1999. </s> <s> That year, he reported getting @-@112,366 in gifts, including thousands in clothing from Jennings Osborne, a wealthy businessman in Little Rock who befriended the family. </s> <s> Mr. Osborne also made regular gifts of pastries and flowers to the governor@-@s mansion. </s> <s> There were also gift certificates to department stores, ties and other items. </s> <s> The gift-taking tailed off in subsequent years @-@ there was @-@5,000 worth in 2003 @-@ but Mr. Huckabee@-@s tangles with the state ethics commission fill a thick binder with documents spanning much of his time as governor. </s> <s> Mr.

<s> But it did find violations in five, including Mr. Huckabee@-@s acceptance of a @-@500 canoe from Coca-Cola and a @-@200 stadium blanket, though a court later threw out the finding on the canoe. </s> <s> As the governor left office, new questions arose over wedding registries set up decades after his marriage began at department stores, including Target, so friends could help furnish the

pattern, in the gift-taking and the defensiveness. </s> <s> Both hark back to his past as a member of the clergy, critics said. </s> <s> Throughout his tenure, allies and enemies alike were struck by

By Don Van Natta Jr., Jo Becker and Mike McIntireThis article is by Don Van Natta Jr., Jo Becker and Mike McIntire. </s> <s> Over the last decade, former President Bill Clinton has raised more than @-@500 million for his foundation, allowing him to build a glass-and-steel presidential library in Little Rock, Ark., and burnish his image as an impresario of global philanthropy. </s> <s> The foundation has closely guarded the identities of its donors @-@ including one who gave @-@31.3 million last year. </s> <s> Now, the secrecy surrounding the William J. Clinton Foundation has become a campaign issue as Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton seeks the Democratic presidential nomination with her husband as a prime source of strategy and star power. </s> <s> Some of her rivals argue that donors could use presidential foundations to circumvent campaign finance laws intended to limit political influence. </s> <s> Mr. Clinton himself echoed those concerns this fall when he pledged to make public future donors if Mrs. Clinton was elected president. </s> <s> While disclosure is not legally required, failure to do so, Mr. Clinton said, would raise @-@all these questions about whether people would try to win favor with her by giving money to me. </s> <s> @-@ Even so, past donors should remain private, he insisted, @-@unless there is some conflict of which I am aware, and there is not. </s> <s> @-@But an examination of the foundation demonstrates how its fund-raising has at times fostered the potential for conflict. </s> <s> The New York Times has

examination found that while some @-@1 million contributors were longtime Clinton friends, others were seeking policy changes from the administration. </s> <s> Two pledged @-@1 million each while they or their companies were under investigation by the Justice Department. </s> <s> Other donations came from supporters who had been ensnared in campaign finance scandals surrounding Mr. Clinton@-@s 1996 re-election campaign. </s> <s> In raising record sums for her campaign, Mrs. Clinton has tapped many of the foundation@-@s donors. </s> <s> At least two dozen have become @-@Hillraisers,@-@ each bundling @-@100,000 or more for her presidential bid. </s> <s> The early library donors, combined with their families and political action committees, have contributed at least @-@784,000 to Mrs.

of the foundation expanded from the Clinton library into issues like treating AIDS in the developing world and addressing global poverty and climate change, and Mrs. Clinton moved closer to announcing her candidacy, the pace of giving quickened. </s> <s> Last year, contributions reached @-@135 million, a 70 percent increase over the previous year. </s> <s> Two-thirds came from just 11 donors. </s> <s> The @-@31.3 million donation, which was previously undisclosed, came from the Radcliffe Foundation run by Frank Giustra, a Canadian who has made millions financing mining deals around the world.

had suggested that the @-@31.3 million contribution listed on its tax return did not come from a single donor. </s> <s> They then said it came from a single source, but declined to identify it. </s> <s> Wednesday afternoon, a representative of Mr. Giustra contacted The Times and acknowledged the Radcliffe contribution. </s> <s> This year, Mr. Giustra announced separate plans to give the Clinton

In at least 45 instances, Mr. Obama voted with large numbers of fellow Democrats as part of the tactical skirmishing with Republicans over the budget. </s> <s> Seven other times, he voted that way as

business acumen @-@ he is the founder of Bain Capital, a prominent private equity firm @-@ is in keeping with how almost all of the leading Republican presidential candidates have been running to varying degree on their competence as a way to distinguish themselves from the Bush administration, without distancing themselves from him ideologically. </s> <s> Nevertheless, Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, spent much of the spring and summer focusing more on bolstering his credentials as a conservative champion as he fended off vigorous criticism for his more moderate past. </s> <s> But Mr. Romney advisers believe they have largely succeeded in establishing his conservative bona fides, even though lingering questions about his authenticity persist, and are able now to move on to targeting the next layer of voters. </s> <s> @-@ @-@If you look now and you ask, @-@Is Mitt Romney a conservative? </s> <s> @-@ People would say, @-@Yes,@-@ @-@ said Russ Schriefer, one of the

<s> @-@ From the beginning, his campaign has oscillated between two distinct, some would say contradictory, themes: Mr. Romney as a conservative standard-bearer and Mr. Romney as a pragmatic problem-solving businessman. </s> <s> His campaign advisers say the themes are complementary, but his critics say the businessman theme comes much more naturally to him while his staunch conservative message was seized for political purposes only. </s> <s> @-@These two messages don@-@t necessarily fit under the same strategic umbrella,@-@ said John Weaver, who ran Senator John McCain@-@s campaign until the summer. </s> <s> @-@They@-@re completely different. </s> <s> I think the governor has struggled to carry those two messages. </s> <s> @-@ The re-emphasis of the managerial argument that many originally thought could make Mr. Romney president @-@ his experience as a pragmatic problem-solving businessman @-@ jibes with the campaign@-@s closing strategy in Iowa, whose caucuses are Jan. 3, and New Hampshire, whose primaries are five days later. </s> <s> Here in New Hamspshire, where a new CNN@-@WMUR polls shows Mr. Romney holding onto his lead, his advisers said their surveys show him faring well among voters focused on taxes and spending. </s> <s> But they add that he has room to grow among what they call @-@economic voters,@-@ who are concerned about jobs, America@-@s competitiveness overseas and other economic issues. </s> <s> @-@We@-@re going to talk about things the governor can do to promote economic growth and how he understands this new global economy,@-@ said Alex Gage, Mr. Romney@-@s director of strategy. </s> <s> Sure enough, in his stump speech here, Mr. Romney spoke on @-@why jobs come and why jobs go@-@ based on lessons he derived from business, and emphasized his work in @-@over 20 countries. </s> <s> @-@ In Iowa, Mr. Romney@-@s advisers believe it will be difficult for him, about two weeks before the contest, to peel off staunch Christian conservative voters from Mr. Huckabee, a former Baptist minister. </s> <s> But they think Mr. Romney can win over others who place more importance on fiscal issues, the economy and immigration. </s> <s> It is one of the reasons Mr. Romney unveiled a spiffy new Powerpoint presentation last week, designed more to showcase his corporate competence than help the audience follow his policy points. </s> <s> But Mr. Weaver , the former McCain adviser, argued that the Romney campaign still has struggled to produce a consistent message. </s> <s> In contrast, Mr. McCain@-@s candidacy immediately evokes the Iraq war and his foreign-policy credentials; for Mr. Giuliani@-@s, it is his handling of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks along with staying on offense against Islamic terrorism. </s> <s> @-@They@-@re having a hard time having both feet planted on either side of the seesaw,@-@ Mr. Weaver said. </s> <s> @-@ Romney@-@s aides agree that they have struggled at times to inculcate their broader message in voters, in part because they were busy parrying attacks early on from their opponents, including Mr. McCain and later Senator Sam Brownback in Iowa. </s> <s> @-@ @-@It took us a while to get other things put to bed so we could stick to a theme and get people to look at us that way because we were answering other questions,@-@ said Tom Rath, a former New Hampshire attorney general and senior adviser. </s> <s> To combat attacks from the right, Mr. Romney debuted a message in May centered around what he called the @-@three legs of the conservative stool@-@ @-@ meant to unite social, fiscal and foreign-policy conservatives behind him. </s> <s> He then spent much of the summer leading into Iowa@-@s straw poll expounding on the idea, only bringing up his private-sector experience in passing. </s> <s> He also presented a much harder line on immigration issues as the campaign progressed. </s> <s> The question at this point is whether Mr. Romney jerked the wheel too hard to the right as he now tries to pick up a broader cross-section of voters. </s> <s> In September, his campaign rolled out a new theme of Mr. Romney as a leader capable of bringing change to Washington. </s> <s> It was change, they sensed, that many in the party ultimately wanted. </s> <s> But it is a message that they have found hard to stick to amid the daily fluctuations of the campaign. </s> <s> @-@ @-@It has been hard to get to the essential, the core,@-@ Mr. Gage said. </s> <s> Now Mr. Romney is trying to get down to it before he runs out of time. </s> <s> The Ad

which are questioning his record on immigration and crime, by pointing out that the Christmas season should be about religion and friends and family @-@ a message that could be effective among Iowans, who are widely believed to dislike negative campaigning. </s> <s> By mentioning @-@Christ@-@ and @-@God@-@ so prominently, though, Mr. Huckabee, an ordained Baptist minister, may be trying to rally the conservative evangelical Christians who are flocking to him while simultaneously drawing a tacit comparison with his closest rival, Mitt Romney, who is a Mormon. </s> <s> While that may work in Iowa, the religiosity of the message may turn off more-secular voters elsewhere, and remind them that Mr. Huckabee has been dismissive of homosexuality and indicated that he does not believe in evolution. </s> <s> MICHAEL COOPER By Patrick HealyDAVENPORT, Iowa @-@ Senator Barack Obama and former Senator John Edwards, two Democratic presidential candidates courting many of the same undecided

Bond, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said that after 40 years in Republican politics, he could not recall a situation where Democrats were so much more enthusiastic about their candidates. </s> <s> @-@When you look at partisan intensity @-@ the question of, @-@Thinking ahead, how interested are you in participating in the election of @-@08? </s> <s> @-@ @-@ there is a 17-point gap between the Republicans and the Democrats,@-@ Mr. </s> <s> Bond said. </s> <s> @-@That is a monster number. </s> <s> It shows that the Republicans are not fired up and it@-@s going to take a nominee who can clearly articulate a post-Bush vision for the country. </s> <s> @-@But should this really be surprising?For one thing, none of these 2008 candidates is particularly identified with @-@movement@-@ conservatism and isn@-@t trusted by conservatives who form the Republican base. </s> <s> Thus a big part of this campaign has been the effort by the candidates to establish @-@ or burnish @-@ their credentials with these voters. </s> <s> @-@There has been more frustration with them with conservatives than with the party as a whole,@-@ said Gary L.

Giuliani of New York will win Florida. </s> <s> In those circumstances, with no obvious front-runner, and with many of the candidates having adequate resources and varying bases of support, they could just divide the prize on Feb. 5 and move on to the next primary. </s> <s> @-@Which means the race might not be over until the convention,@-@ said Peter Robinson, a fellow with the Hoover Institution and a speechwriter in the Reagan White House. </s> <s> @-@I know there comes a time every year when journalists say this is going to be decided at the convention. </s> <s> I won@-@t say it@-@s probable, but it is possible: This race just won@-@t close. </s> <s> @-@Still, there are considerable obstacles to a protracted nominating battle. </s> <s> For one thing, if Democrats have a nominee and Republicans do not, there will be considerable pressure from Republican leaders to try to end what could be a debilitating primary fight in the form of pressure on weaker candidates to drop out. </s> <s> An extended contest seems possible on the Democratic side, but less so, because there are fewer strong candidates to divide the Feb. 5 take. </s> <s> The Republicans have four seriously viable candidates: Mr. Romney, Mr. McCain, Mr. Huckabee and Mr. Giuliani. </s> <s> The Democrats have three, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards. </s> <s> Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama and Mr. Edwards are engaged in a remarkably tight fight here, and any one of them could win on Jan. 3. </s> <s> But here@-@s one thing to keep in mind: Unless they are all bunched up together on caucus night, someone has to come in third, a fact that the campaigns do not like to think about a lot. </s> <s> And that could test the three-tickets-out-of-Iowa rule as never before. </s> <s> That is particularly true for Mr. Edwards @-@ who has almost lived in Iowa for the past two years, almost won here in 2004, and is trailing in polls in New Hampshire. </s> <s> It seems safe to say that a third-place finish for Mr. Edwards would be the end of the line for him, no matter how many times his aides might invoke the @-@three tickets out of Iowa@-@ line that night. </s> <s> Barring an unexpected showing from one of the other Democrats in the field, that would set up a two-way contest between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama going into New Hampshire. </s> <s> If Mrs. Clinton comes in third, she would no doubt go on. </s> <s> But she would be heading into New Hampshire, where polls suggest Mr. Obama is already rising, and where she would only have five days to turn things around. </s> <s> Not easy. </s> <s> Mr. Obama would also no doubt continue should he trail Mr. Edwards and Mrs. Clinton. </s> <s> But he would be damaged goods, particularly after a month here in which he seems to have gone a long way to ease any Democratic doubts that voter concerns about his experience or his race would hurt him at the ballot box. </s> <s> There was a time when many Democrats did not think Mr. Edwards could survive even a second-place showing here. </s> <s> But with one caveat @-@ he would need to raise a lot of money, and raise it fast @-@ Mr. Edwards@-@ advisers argue that he in fact could weather a second-place showing because that would almost certainly mean that he had beaten either Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Obama, no small feat this year. </s> <s> By Maria AspanA usual round of

president-to-be. </s> <s> One reason for that outcome was the deft use of media, new and traditional, by the Barack Obama campaign as well as by his supporters. </s> <s> An example of an official ad that broke through was a 30-minute infomercial that the campaign ran on seven broadcast and cable networks on Oct. 29. </s> <s> The commercial, filmed like a documentary, managed to be slick and

unofficial Obama ad that succeeded was a video clip, produced by the musician Will.i.am, called @-@Yes We Can,@-@ which was viewed on YouTube and other video-sharing Web sites more than 20 million times. </s> <s> STOVE TOP Almost 50 years after Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon demonstrated that in Chicago, some like it hot, Kraft Foods turned on the heat there to promote its Stove Top brand of

@-@It reflects the strength of the candidates and their resources. </s> <s> @-@ The ability of the House candidates to run ahead of Mr. Obama has potential significance for the strengthened Democratic

new administration, freeing them to vote independently if they see some daylight between their constituents and the Obama administration. </s> <s> To some degree, House Democrats will remain free agents. </s> <s> Democratic officials play down this potential for tension, saying the newly elected Democrats and Mr. Obama are on the same page, particularly when it comes to the economy. </s> <s> And many of the Democrats who won in moderate and Republican leaning districts emphasized a desire to work with Republicans and reduce partisan tensions @-@ a main theme of the Obama campaign as well.

some of our candidates had to go above and beyond that and carve out a political identity separate from the national campaign. </s> <s> @-@ That would be the case in the Idaho race won by Walt

put Mr. </s> <s> Bright over the top. </s> <s> Mr. Obama clearly was factor in defeating Republicans like Chris Shays of Connecticut by running ahead of the successful Democrat in that race, Jim Himes. </s> <s> He also outperformed another Democratic winner Steve Driehaus of Ohio, in his challenge against Representative Steve Chabot, a Republican. </s> <s> Mr. Chabot had always before been able to hold off Democrats in a Cincinnati-area district with a significant percentage of African-American voters. </s> <s> Mr. Obama and the Democratic candidates who picked up two seats in Michigan ran about neck-and-neck; voters there may have been driven by the battered economy to pick new leadership. </s> <s> In places like Florida, Republicans had a hand in beating themselves by getting caught in personal scandals, and the presidential race was less of a factor. </s> <s> By and large, House Democrats showed an ability to succeed on their own. </s> <s> They might want to remember that

Brennan, an agency veteran who was widely seen as the front-runner, withdrew from consideration amid concerns that he was linked to controversial intelligence programs authorized by Mr. Bush. </s> <s> In a letter to Mr. Obama, Mr. Brennan said he did not want those concerns to be a @-@distraction@-@ for the incoming administration. </s> <s> At the same time, he vigorously defended his record and called himself a @-@strong opponent@-@ of the harsh interrogation methods the agency used in recent years, including waterboarding, the practice of making a suspect experience the sensation of drowning. </s> <s> The developments came as Mr. Obama prepared to begin unveiling his national security team after the long Thanksgiving weekend. </s> <s> Besides formally announcing his nomination of Mrs. Clinton as secretary of state, Mr. Obama was expected to appoint Gen. James L. Jones, a retired Marine commandant and NATO supreme commander, as his national security adviser. </s> <s> Other front-runners have emerged in recent days, including Adm. Dennis Blair, retired from the Navy, for director of national intelligence; Susan E. Rice, a former assistant secretary of state, for ambassador to the United Nations; James B. Steinberg, a former deputy national security adviser, for deputy secretary of state; and Thomas E. Donilon, a former chief of staff at the State Department, for deputy national security adviser. </s> <s> The team is shaping up as one of experience more than change, figures with long r@-@sum@-@s but at times conflicting backgrounds. </s> <s> Nothing reflects that more than keeping a Republican-appointed defense secretary. </s> <s> Although Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Gerald R. Ford made no change at the top of the Pentagon when they took office, no president has kept a defense secretary from a predecessor in another party, Donald Ritchie, a Senate historian, said. </s> <s> Mr. Gates, who served as C. I. </s> <s> A. director under the first President Bush, would not have to be reconfirmed by the Senate. </s> <s> The prospect of retaining him generated praise from the military establishment and Capitol Hill, where he is viewed as a pragmatist who turned the Pentagon around after the tumultuous tenure of Donald H. Rumsfeld. </s> <s> But it also stirred a debate inside Mr. Obama@-@s circles, where some advisers worried that the decision to turn to a Republican appointee @-@ something President Bill Clinton did in naming William S. Cohen to the defense post in 1997 @-@ would reinforce the notion that Democrats could not manage the military. </s> <s> @-@It makes them look like they@-@re too wimpy to be trusted to run the building,@-@ said one adviser who asked not to be named. </s> <s> Keeping Mr. Gates after a polarizing campaign on the war also seemed incongruous to some. </s> <s> @-@I really can@-@t begin to understand from a political point of view how Barack Obama, a person who got the nomination because he ran against the Iraq war, can keep around the guy who@-@s been in charge of it for the last two years,@-@ said Loren B. Thompson, head of the Lexington Institute, a research organization. </s> <s> Mr. Gates talked with Mr. Obama@-@s team about how to make the arrangement work. </s> <s> One adviser familiar with the discussions said the final issue was the choice of senior Pentagon personnel and whether a small circle of Gates advisers would remain. </s> <s> Obama advisers have talked about Richard J. Danzig, a former Navy secretary, as a possible deputy and heir apparent to Mr. Gates, but some acknowledged that the prospect could raise concerns. </s> <s> If Mr. Danzig is sitting down the hall from the secretary@-@s office and seen as Mr. Obama@-@s real choice, some said, then his presence could undercut Mr. Gates@-@s authority. </s> <s> But Mr. Gates has shown an ability to manage the Pentagon even with a small inner circle. </s> <s> When he took over from Mr. Rumsfeld after the 2006 midterm elections, Mr. Gates did not bring a single new aide. </s> <s> And the senior military officer corps will remain unchanged at the start of the administration, including Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. </s> <s> Admiral Mullen made an unannounced trip to Chicago on Friday for a 45-minute meeting with Mr. Obama on a wide range of national security issues, Pentagon officials said. </s> <s> Before going, Admiral Mullen received approval from both Mr. Gates and Mr. Bush, the officials said. </s> <s> The decision by Mr. Brennan to pull out of consideration for a senior intelligence job surprised specialists and lawmakers, some of whom questioned whether he had been forced by Mr. Obama@-@s team to withdraw. </s> <s> Mr. Obama@-@s office denied pushing Mr. Brennan aside. </s> <s> The episode underscored how the C. I. </s> <s> A. </s> <s> @-@s secret detention program remained an incendiary issue. </s> <s> Mr. Brennan, who will continue to work on Mr. Obama@-@s transition team, was a senior adviser during the campaign and said an Obama administration would ban coercive interrogation. </s> <s> Yet a group of psychologists posted a letter on the Internet last weekend calling for Mr. Obama to pass over Mr. Brennan, quoting a 2006 interview with the PBS program @-@Frontline@-@ in which he seemed to defend C.

Tribe, a professor at Harvard Law School who taught Mr. Obama when he was a law student there. </s> <s> Another early decision facing the administration will be whether to work with the Democratic-controlled Congress to investigate the Bush administration officials who approved and ran the wiretapping program. </s> <s> While Congress gave the telecommunications companies legal immunity, it did not extend immunity to administration officials. </s> <s> Some Democratic lawmakers have said they would like to conduct a more thorough investigation than was possible during Mr. Bush@-@s tenure, but other Democratic advisers say they see little gain from trying to investigate past abuses and that an investigation risks harming the bipartisan spirit of cooperation that Mr. Obama has promised. </s> <s> Since the election, Mr. Obama has not said whether his administration would engage in such inquiries of his predecessor@-@s government. </s> <s> But Mr. Obama was one of only 15 senators who voted against the confirmation of Michael V.

might still be swamped by the crime wave that engulfed the country in the 1960s and @-@70s. </s> <s> The surge in crime rates, which lasted until the early 1990s, was driven by a variety of factors @-@ the demographic bulge created by the baby boom, the crisis of authority in the late @-@60s, and the heroin and crack epidemics that followed. </s> <s> But it was abetted by a softheaded liberalism

Maurice Clemmons. </s> <s> But the political context is completely different. </s> <s> The age of furloughs is long gone. </s> <s> For a generation now, conservatives, not Dukakis-style liberals, have been making policy on crime. </s> <s> They@-@ve built more prisons, imposed harsher sentences and locked up as many lawbreakers as possible. </s> <s> Their approach has worked. </s> <s> The violent crime rate has been cut by nearly 40 percent since its early-1990s peak. </s> <s> The murder rate is at its lowest point since Lyndon Johnson was president. </s> <s> Yet the costs of this success have been significant: 2.3 million Americans are behind bars. </s> <s> Our prison system tolerates gross abuses, including rape on a disgraceful scale. </s> <s> Poor communities are warped by the absence of so many fathers and brothers. </s> <s> And every American community is burdened by the expense of building and staffing enough prisons to keep up with our swelling convict population. </s> <s> Mass

excuse-making of the @-@60s and @-@70s. </s> <s> Nor does it require every governor to issue frequent pardons. </s> <s> @-@A capricious mercy doesn@-@t further the cause of justice. </s> <s> @-@ Instead, it requires a more sophisticated crime-fighting approach @-@ an emphasis, for instance, on making sentences swifter and more certain, even as we make them shorter; a system of performance

Barack Obama@-@s 2008 presidential campaign @-@ for the passion, the clarity, the bliss-to-be-alive fervor. </s> <s> They argue that these things are missing in a cautious and emotionless White House. </s> <s> But, of course, the Obama campaign, like all presidential campaigns, was built on a series of fictions. </s> <s> The first fiction was that government is a contest between truth and error. </s> <s> In reality, government is usually a contest between competing, unequal truths. </s> <s> The second fiction was that to support a policy is to make it happen. </s> <s> In fact, in government power is exercised through other people. </s> <s> It is only by coaxing, prodding and compromise that presidents actually get anything done. </s> <s> The third fiction was that we can begin the world

presidents have to adjust to these realities when they move to the White House. </s> <s> The only surprise with President Obama is how enthusiastically he has made the transition. </s> <s> He@-@s political, like any president, but he seems to vastly prefer the grays of governing to the simplicities of the campaign. </s> <s> The election revolved around passionate rallies. </s> <s> The Obama White House revolves around a culture of debate. </s> <s> He leads long, analytic discussions, which bring competing arguments to the fore. </s> <s> He sometimes seems to preside over the arguments

foreign and domestic, he seems to spend a lot of time coaxing people along. </s> <s> His governing style, in short, is biased toward complexity. </s> <s> This style has never been more evident than in his decision to expand the war in Afghanistan. </s> <s> America traditionally fights its wars in a spirit of moral fervor. </s> <s> Most war presidents cast themselves as heroes on a white charger, believing that no one heeds an uncertain trumpet. </s> <s> Obama, on the other hand, cloaked himself in what you might call Niebuhrian modesty. </s> <s> His decision to expand the war is the most morally consequential one of his presidency so far, yet as the moral stakes rose, Obama@-@s emotional temperature cooled to just above freezing. </s> <s> He spoke Tuesday night in the manner of an unwilling volunteer, balancing the arguments within his administration by leading the country deeper in while pointing the way out. </s> <s> Despite the ambivalence, he did act. </s> <s> This is not mishmash. </s> <s> With his two surges, Obama will more than double the number of American troops in Afghanistan. </s> <s> As Andrew Ferguson of The Weekly Standard pointed out, he is the first Democratic president in 40 years to deploy a significant number of troops into a war zone. </s> <s> Those new troops are not themselves a strategy; they are enablers of an evolving strategy. </s> <s> Over the next year, there will be disasters, errors and surprises @-@ as in all wars. </s> <s> But the generals will have more resources with which to cope and respond. </s> <s> If the generals continue to find that stationing troops in the villages of Helmand Province leads to the revival of Afghan society, they will have the troops to do more of that. </s> <s> If they continue to find that order can be maintained only if social development accompanies military action, they will have more troops for that. </s> <s> We have no way of knowing now how those troops will end up being used. </s> <s> And we have no clue if it will be wise to withdraw them in July 2011. </s> <s> The advantage of the Obama governing style is that his argument-based organization is a learning organization. </s> <s> Amid the torrent of memos and evidence and dispute, the Obama administration is able to adjust and respond more quickly than, say, the Bush administration ever did. </s> <s> The disadvantage is the tendency to bureaucratize the war. </s> <s> Armed conflict is about morale, motivation, honor, fear and breaking the enemy@-@s will. </s> <s> The danger is that Obama@-@s analytic mode will neglect the intangibles that are the essence of the fight. </s> <s> It will fail to inspire and comfort. </s> <s> Soldiers and Marines don@-@t have the luxury of adopting President Obama@-@s

But we should still be glad that he is governing the way he is. </s> <s> I loved covering the Obama campaign. </s> <s> But amid problems like Afghanistan and health care, it simply wouldn@-@t do to

dispassion. </s> <s> By Kate ZernikeWhen Mike Huckabee, a former Southern Baptist minister then serving as governor of Arkansas, granted clemency to Maurice Clemmons nine years ago, he cited his age: Mr. Clemmons was 16 when he began the crime spree for which he was sentenced to more than 100 years in prison. </s> <s> Now, Mr. Clemmons is being sought as the suspect in the killing of four uniformed police officers, execution-style, on Sunday as they sat in a coffee shop near Tacoma, Wash., writing reports. </s> <s> Mr. Huckabee, now a Fox News talk-show host, has been leading the pack of possible Republican contenders for president in 2012. </s> <s> But the killings of the police officers are focusing renewed attention on his long-contentious record of pardoning convicts or commuting their sentences. </s> <s> In a decade as governor beginning in 1996, Mr. Huckabee did so twice as many times as his three predecessors combined. </s> <s> He typically gave little explanation for individual pardons. </s> <s> But he spoke often of his belief in redemption, based on a strong religious belief that even criminals are capable of changing their lives and often deserve a second chance. </s> <s> He also raised concerns about the fairness of the Arkansas justice system. </s> <s> The commutation of Mr. Clemmons@-@s sentence was routine enough that it failed to make a list of Mr. Huckabee@-@s 10 @-@most publicized@-@ prison commutations compiled by an Arkansas newspaper in August 2004. </s> <s> And if it turns out to be a case in which a parole had gone bad, it will be difficult to pin responsibility solely on Mr. Huckabee, because many others made decisions that kept Mr. Clemmons out of prison. </s> <s> Mr. Clemmons had been convicted for a series of burglaries and robberies that began in 1989, and would not have been eligible for parole until 2021. </s> <s> He applied for clemency in 2000, writing in a petition to Mr. Huckabee that he had simply fallen in with a bad crowd in a bad neighborhood as a teenager, and that he @-@had learned through the @-@school of hard knocks@-@ to appreciate and respect the rights of others.@-@Mr. </s> <s> Huckabee commuted his sentence, making him eligible for immediate parole. </s> <s> Within six months, Mr. Clemmons violated the conditions of his parole, returning to prison in July 2001 for aggravated robbery. </s> <s> When he was paroled again by the state in 2004, the police in Little Rock served a warrant on him related to a 2001 robbery. </s> <s> But a lawyer for Mr. Clemmons argued that too much time had elapsed since the warrant was issued, and prosecutors dropped the charges. </s> <s> Mr. Huckabee, who rode a brand of prairie populism to finish second in the Republican presidential primaries in 2008, granted more than 1,000 pardons or clemency requests as governor. </s> <s> As his reputation for granting clemency spread, more convicts applied. </s> <s> Aides said he read each file personally. </s> <s> In most cases, he followed the recommendation of the parole board, but in several cases he overrode the objections of prosecutors, judges and victims@-@ families. </s> <s> And in several, he followed recommendations for clemency from Baptist preachers who had been longtime supporters. </s> <s> Prosecutors told him he was ignoring his responsibility to explain to citizens why he was setting free convicted murderers and rapists. </s> <s> His response, some of them say, was to blame others and strike out against his critics @-@ an off-note from a man they consider a gifted politician. </s> <s> @-@Victims groups were pretty well ignored, along with boots-on-the-streets law enforcement and good citizens who sit on these juries,@-@ said Larry Jegley, who objected to Mr. Clemmons@-@s clemency request as the prosecuting attorney for Pulaski County, where he was convicted. </s> <s> Robert Herzfeld, then the prosecuting attorney of Saline County, wrote a letter to Governor Huckabee in January 2004, saying his policy on clemency was @-@fatally flawed@-@ and suggesting that he should announce specific reasons for granting clemency. </s> <s> Mr. Huckabee@-@s chief aide on clemency wrote back: @-@The governor read your letter and laughed out loud. </s> <s> He wanted me to respond to you. </s> <s> I wish you success as you cut down on your caffeine consumption. </s> <s> @-@It was all a very personal issue for him,@-@ said Mr. Herzfeld, who later sued successfully to overturn one of Mr. Huckabee@-@s clemency decisions, which would have set free a man convicted in a bludgeoning death. </s> <s> @-@It was always about how I was trying to get him or another prosecutor was trying to get him, not about how to do it right. </s> <s> He@-@s brilliant politically and very likable, but it seems like there@-@s a blind spot on this issue. </s> <s> @-@With Mr. Clemmons, political consultants say Mr. Huckabee may have hit his Willie Horton moment @-@As a front-runner, obviously with circumstances like this, it@-@s out there as a big issue,@-@ said Ed Rollins, the manager of Mr. Huckabee@-@s 2008 presidential campaign. </s> <s> Mr. Huckabee survived a similar moment before, during the Iowa caucuses, when former Gov. </s> <s> Mitt Romney of Massachusetts criticized his judgment in the case of Wayne DuMond, a convicted rapist who raped and killed a woman 11 months after being paroled in Arkansas. </s> <s> Mr. Huckabee said that he had opposed clemency, and that it had been his predecessor, Jim Guy Tucker, who had made Mr. DuMond eligible for parole by reducing his sentence. </s> <s> @-@If anyone needs to get a Willie Horton out of it, it@-@s Jim Guy Tucker and the Democrat Party and it ain@-@t me,@-@ he said to reporters at the time. </s> <s> But Mr. Huckabee had come into office saying he intended to commute Mr. DuMond@-@s sentence. </s> <s> He later denied the request only as the state@-@s board granted Mr. DuMond parole. </s> <s> Members of the board later said they had been pressured by the governor. </s> <s> Mr. Clemmons@-@s case packs more potency: the facts of Mr. Huckabee@-@s involvement in the clemency decision are less in dispute, and the crime has played over and over on national television. </s> <s> @-@It@-@s the same issue yet again,@-@ said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. </s> <s> @-@The difference this time is that Governor Huckabee would start with greater visibility and higher in the polls, which always enhances and exacerbates any possible criticisms. </s> <s> @-@Should he run, there are many prosecutors and victims@-@ advocates in Arkansas who say they are ready to argue to the national news media that this is just one of the cases where Mr. Huckabee used poor judgment and ignored an

that came to mind was when Richard M. Nixon announced in 1962 that he was leaving politics for good, after losing the governor@-@s race in California, two years after a failed White House bid. </s> <s> In fact, Nixon used the next six years to quietly refurbish his image, building ties with the conservative wing that was becoming ascendant in the Republican Party, ingratiating himself with Republican senators and candidates for governor by campaigning on their behalf, and becoming better schooled in issues. </s> <s> @-@He even made efforts, though decidedly limited, to fix his difficult relationship with the news media. </s> <s> @-@Assuming her departure does reflect a strategic decision to prepare for a presidential campaign @-@ Republicans have been wondering why she quit so abruptly @-@ Ms. Palin may be looking to the next few years to do what Nixon did to prepare for his successful run for the White House in 1968. </s> <s> Yet Ms. Palin is in a different place than was Nixon, or any other politician who has gone the rehabilitation route. </s> <s> She is viewed disparagingly by many of the elites in her party, no matter how many conservative Republicans have flocked to her. </s> <s> She has grown increasingly unpopular in her own state and nationally; 43 percent of respondents questioned nationally in a CNN Poll in May viewed her unfavorably, compared with 21 percent shortly after Senator John McCain of Arizona chose her as his running mate last August. </s> <s> And unlike Nixon@-@s, Ms. Palin@-@s credentials are a weak point. </s> <s> Nixon had been a vice president, a senator and a member of the House, while Ms. Palin is in her first term as governor of Alaska. </s> <s> By stepping down before finishing her term, she cannot claim to be even a one-term governor. </s> <s> Without a positive record of accomplishment as governor, Ms. Palin may find she has little to run on as she seeks to achieve a critical political goal: expanding her appeal beyond the conservative voters who crowd her rallies and write checks on her behalf. </s> <s> @-@I think a lot of it has been unfair, but, fair or unfair, there has been a question in the eyes of most Republican primary voters about whether she has demonstrated an ability to govern,@-@ said Sara Taylor, who was the White House political director under President George W. Bush. </s> <s> @-@So the best opportunity you have to demonstrate you can lead is to do it, and you can@-@t lead if you don@-@t have a platform. </s> <s> @-@So I do think that this is a mistake if she

</s> <s> @-@If one of Ms. Palin@-@s goals was to erase the perception of her as flighty, a perception encouraged by some McCain lieutenants in the rough aftermath of the failed campaign, it certainly

Palin@-@s goals was, as she suggested, to put an end to the rush of what she described as hectoring investigations from the news media, the sheer frenzy of the reaction to her decision was a reminder of how difficult that might prove to be. </s> <s> Even her lawyer put out a statement late Saturday denying what he called @-@false and defamatory allegations@-@ that her resignation stemmed from a criminal investigation. </s> <s> It is unclear precisely what Ms. Palin intends to do. </s> <s> The assumption, given her remarks and record over the past year, is that she sees an opportunity now, with the ranks of potential Republican presidential candidates so depleted. </s> <s> In fact, assuming she has any interest in staying in national politics, she might be more interested in filling another vacuum and positioning herself as the de facto leader of the social conservative movement. </s> <s> Even if she did not run herself, she could be extremely influential as Republicans move to choose a presidential candidate in 2012, given the power conservatives have in the party nomination process. </s> <s> And there is an argument, advanced by some of her supporters, that this might be a risk worth taking, given the problems she has had as a national figure. </s> <s> Even if serving as governor might have allowed her to build up a record to run for higher office, as Ms. Taylor argued, her departure removes what has proved to be a bruising political environment at home. </s> <s> Not incidentally, it frees her to move closer to where the action is in the 2012 presidential race. </s> <s> @-@And she has a following that will jump in front of a plane for her,@-@ said John Coale, a lawyer who helped create her political action committee. </s> <s> @-@If she takes this time to develop that base, she could be a real force in the Republican Party, and maybe run. </s> <s> @-@Jonah Goldberg, an editor at large at the conservative National Review Online, posted an open letter to Ms. Palin even before she announced her decision, urging her to use the time before the 2012 race to fill in what he said were deficiencies in her knowledge that had hampered her as a vice-presidential candidate. </s> <s> @-@So here@-@s my advice,@-@ Mr. Goldberg wrote. </s> <s> @-@Stay home and do your job and your homework. </s> <s> You@-@ll still be a national figure come the primaries. </s> <s>

attributed the findings to several factors beyond the obvious one: Barack Obama@-@s candidacy. </s> <s> For instance, the number of eligible Hispanic voters has soared by more than 21 percent since

<s> In 2008, for the first time, the share of white non-Hispanic eligible voters fell below 75 percent. </s> <s> @-@What this report demonstrates is a pretty potent one-two punch of demographic change

and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. </s> <s> Despite widespread predictions of record voter turnout last November, the overall rate was virtually the same as in 2004. </s> <s> But the composition of the electorate changed. </s> <s> The turnout among eligible whites declined slightly, by 1.1 percent, but rose by 4.9 percent among blacks. </s> <s> In 2004, the gap between white and black turnout rates was nearly seven percentage points. </s> <s> It was less than one percentage point four years later. </s> <s> Polls during the campaign found that young people in

voters, compared with about 12 percent in 1988. </s> <s> The analysis found that Southern states with large populations of black eligible voters recorded the greatest increase in turnout rates. </s> <s> In Mississippi, the rate increased by eight percentage points compared with 2004 @-@ to 69.7 percent, from 61.7 percent. </s> <s> Mr. Obama scored upsets in several Southern states. </s> <s> Those

presidency seem, at times, so confounding. </s> <s> First Obama endured an electoral embarrassment, watching his party lose off-year gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia, in part because many of the voters he had so successfully engaged in his presidential campaign, particularly younger voters, stayed home and made popcorn for @-@Dancing With the Stars@-@ instead. </s> <s> The president had been exposed, the pundits solemnly declared, as having no @-@coattails,@-@ which are something you really need, they said, if you want congressmen and senators to go along with you on hard votes. </s> <s> Then, just five days later, as Obama@-@s manifest political weakness was still being dissected on cable TV, the president stood in the Rose Garden and hailed the passage in the House of Representatives of the most comprehensive health care bill in the nation@-@s history @-@ a bill he had helped pass, narrowly but solidly, by making a rare weekend visit to the Capitol to lobby for it personally. </s> <s> It was, as Obama acknowledged, just a first step, but it was a step no other president had managed to scale, and it seemed to confuse this issue of how powerful a president Obama really is. </s> <s> If Obama has no coattails, then how was he able to pressure nervous lawmakers into making such a perilous vote? </s> <s> And if he had enough influence to get health care reform done, then why were his coattails missing?This whole conversation about coattails must baffle most voters under 40, who have no visual sense of what a coattail actually is, unless they@-@ve played a lot of Monopoly or overdressed for a prom. </s> <s> The term dates back to Abraham Lincoln, who accused his adversaries of hiding under the dangling coattails of a general@-@s uniform. </s> <s> The modern idea is that candidates can grab onto the coat of a successful president and glide to victory. </s> <s> This makes some sense when it is used to refer to the years when a presidential candidate is actually on the ballot, the oft-cited demonstration being 1980, when Ronald Reagan@-@s power at the polls helped unseat nine incumbent Democratic senators. </s> <s> But the coattails metaphor has now apparently been extended to refer to the basic transferable appeal of a president, whether he himself is up for election or not. </s> <s> In other words, if Obama is wearing sturdy coattails, then the same New Jersey voters who waited in line last year to elect an exciting young African-American president should have been willing to make the same sacrifice for an unpopular white governor, just because Obama himself told them they should. </s> <s> In fact, though, some of the most successful navigators of the modern culture @-@ in advertising, sports,

top-down party organization, the kind of machine-era figurehead who once presided over conventions full of straw hats and placards. </s> <s> We care about his plans for health care and economic growth, and maybe even about the kind of movies he watches or whether his marriage is holding up under the strain, but we don@-@t necessarily see much connection between his agenda and the fight over

because they are betting that Obama @-@ whose approval rating runs more than 30 points above the Democratic Congress @-@ will ultimately persuade their constituents that it was the right vote to make. </s> <s> The real problem for Obama is that he hasn@-@t really done that yet. </s> <s> The White House has, to this point, mostly directed its power to persuade toward committee chairmen and other lawmakers, turning its attention to a broader public campaign only sporadically, when pressed to defend its agenda by tea-party protesters and fading poll numbers. </s> <s> As a result, perhaps, public support for each of Obama@-@s signature initiatives, including health care, remains lower than support for the president himself. </s> <s> In other words, without a sustained sales pitch to the voters, Obama has yet to convert his personal good will with the electorate into corresponding enthusiasm for his agenda. </s> <s> And as anxious congressmen study poll numbers and look toward their own re-election campaigns next year, that@-@s bound to become a more pressing problem for the White House. </s> <s> Lawmakers may yet be persuaded to enact the president@-@s ambitious agenda,

writers @-@who are far from alone@-@ describe a @-@tour de force,@-@ the @-@sort of speech that only Barack Obama could give. </s> <s> @-@ Afterward, @-@he found everyone in tears @-@ his wife, his friends, hardened campaign aides. </s> <s> Only Obama seemed cool and detached. </s> <s> @-@ Reporters following Mc@-@Cain, most of whom appear to like and admire the candidate, focus nevertheless on the lurching, ad hoc and often self-destructive quality of the Republican campaign. </s> <s> They write with slightly disguised scorn of the reckless choice of Sarah Palin as the vice presidential candidate, and about McCain@-@s own seemingly desperate efforts to find an issue, any issue, that might work. </s> <s> The Democrats had enormous advantages entering the 2008 campaign, and almost any candidate they might have chosen would probably have defeated the Republicans. </s> <s> But Newsweek makes a persuasive case both for the exceptional quality of the Obama campaign and for the ways in which it displayed skills that will be of value in the White House. </s> <s> In many respects, @-@The Plan,@-@ by Rahm Emanuel and Bruce Reed, a blueprint for a revived progressive agenda, is the most interesting of the recent policy books, largely because one of its authors is soon to be the White House chief of staff. </s> <s> In other ways, it has a dated, almost quaint, quality @-@ a book written in 2005, first published in 2006 and quickly republished in 2008 without revision and thus without reference to the epochal financial crisis that will undoubtedly dominate the first years of the Obama presidency. </s> <s> It includes a de rigueur critique of the Bush administration@-@s policies and an intelligent, if predictable, laundry list of policies that a Democratic presi@-@dency might make possible. </s> <s> Among them are the unachieved Clinton-era idea of mandatory national service, a watered-down proposal for universal health care for children only, a plan for supporting college costs for middle-class families. </s> <s> It promotes @-@fiscal responsibility and an end to corporate welfare as we know it,@-@ which largely translates into repealing the Bush tax cuts and strengthening corporate and financial regulation. </s> <s> It proposes a more multilateral approach to the war on terror and a @-@hybrid economy that cuts America@-@s gasoline consumption in half over the next decade. </s> <s> @-@ Obama, of course, has proposed bolder plans @-@ among them universal access to health care for all citizens and an expanded vision of a green economy with a more aggressive timetable @-@proposals that may have rough sledding during a historic recession@-@. </s> <s> Emanuel and Reed strongly support the controversial Clinton welfare reform of 1996, which the authors call @-@the most successful social policy experiment in a generation. </s> <s> @-@ They reject what they consider the sterile choice between @-@more risk, more reward@-@ @-@the conservative prescription@-@ and @-@no risk, just reward@-@ @-@the liberal prescription@-@. </s> <s> Their prescription @-@ which they call @-@a new theory based on old American values@-@ @-@ is @-@more

</s> <s> In the turbulent years since the publication of Emanuel and Reed@-@s book, a sudden and powerful shift has occurred in the goals of hopeful liberals. </s> <s> The financial catastrophe of the last year has strengthened their belief in the need to challenge the apparently discredited @-@trickle-down@-@ economic orthodoxy that has dominated much of the last three decades and to create an economy that strengthens the working and middle classes. </s> <s> The importance of a @-@bottom-up@-@ economy is the central argument of John R. Talbott, a former investment banker turned writer and commentator. </s> <s> His faith in Obama@-@s commitment to Talbott@-@s own economic beliefs is almost without limit. </s> <s> The book weaves excerpts from Obama@-@s speeches and writings into an implausibly specific and coherent set of policies that Talbott insists are the core of the new president@-@s agenda. </s> <s> It includes many of the same proposals that liberals and progressives have been promoting for years, but at its heart is Talbott@-@s belief that Obama will fundamentally transform economic life to serve the needs of the less affluent majority of American citizens. </s> <s> Robert Kuttner, an accomplished economics writer and a founding editor of the liberal magazine The American Prospect, is more skeptical. </s> <s> Obama, he argues, is a @-@work in progress,@-@ at times an embodiment of the most expansive progressive hopes, at other points a moderate centrist moving cautiously and politically through the thickets of his time. </s> <s> Kuttner sees great potential in Obama@-@s leadership and rhetorical skills, but he worries that he will not act boldly enough to attack a financial crisis that has grown considerably more serious since his book went to press. </s> <s> Kuttner@-@s call for a @-@600 billion recovery program @-@startling at the time of its writing@-@ now seems at the low end of the likely response, as he himself would probably now admit. </s> <s> But he is equally concerned about the longer-term future. </s> <s> That future will, he argues, require a major restructuring of the American financial markets through a significantly enhanced federal regulatory regime and @-@structural reforms in labor-market and trade policy as well as health and energy. </s> <s> @-@ And it will require not just a short-term stimulus but a long-term investment in institutions and infrastructure. </s> <s> The current crisis will, he insists, require a truly transformative presidency @-@ no less transformative than the New Deal. </s> <s> His thoughtful, hopeful and apprehensive book is a particularly valuable guide to what the progressive left hopes to see in the Obama presidency. </s> <s> Running through almost all the recent literature from liberal-progressive writers in 2008 is a long-deferred concern of the left: inequality. </s> <s> Thirty-five years ago, the American economy @-@ for decades before a great engine of growth and an effective vehicle of upward mobility @-@ began to move onto a different path. </s> <s> Instead of providing growth more or less evenly across the population, it began to concentrate income and wealth in the upper brackets. </s> <s> This was not a product solely, or even primarily, of government policy, but part of a global shift in the ways markets worked. </s> <s> But American public policy through most of the subsequent years not only tolerated, but actively promoted, this growing inequality. </s> <s> Over time, the new concentration of wealth came to be seen by its beneficiaries, and by much of the political world, as a great source of investment and growth; and those who challenged that claim were often accused of @-@class warfare. </s> <s> @-@ The progressives who have hitched their wagons to Barack Obama@-@s star want many things from him. </s> <s> But among the most important of their hopes is for a shift in how wealth and income are distributed. </s> <s> There are many vehicles available for pursuing this goal @-@ tax policy, minimum wage, public support for education and health care, and a wide range of other programs eagerly supported by newly mobilized liberals. </s> <s> But undoing the forces that have created a generation of mounting inequality will not easily give way to incremental solutions. </s> <s> One of the great triumphs of Obama@-@s campaign and election is that he has made it possible to believe that such accomplishments are within the nation@-@s reach. </s> <s> One of the great dangers of his victory is that it may have created expectations far beyond what any one man, or even any one nation, can realistically hope to achieve. </s> <s> Op-Ed ContributorBy Jesse L.
