Rubin, who has led the effort to design rescue packages for Asian nations, Russia and Latin America, has urged Mr. Clinton to be cautious in limiting the ability of those nations to export goods to the United States, their main source of hard currency now. </s> <s> Any effort to cut off the American market, Mr. Rubin noted today in a sharp exchange with George Becker, the steelworkers @-@ union chief, could have consequences that are adverse to workers in other industries and consumers who have benefited from low-priced imports. </s> <s> Mr. Rubin has also cautioned that any move by the United States to close its markets could be taken as a signal by other nations that they are free to do the same. </s> <s> We don @-@ t want to encourage greater protectionism abroad, he told Mr. Becker during a meeting of the export council. </s> <s> But Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley; the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and the President @-@ s political advisers have all urged more aggressive action, noting that layoffs have already begun in the steel industry and warning that they could spread elsewhere. </s> <s> On Friday, Mr. Gore, who is increasingly attentive to the demands of both business and labor unions, warned a group of top European executives that the United States cannot be the importer of only resort for the world @-@ s ailing nations. </s> <s> The phrase has since been repeated by others in the Administration. </s> <s> Mr. Daley has been blunter. </s> <s> Noting that imports of Japanese<unk> hot-rolled steel, used for construction products, had increased <unk> this year, he said on Friday that we cannot sustain these rates. </s> <s> We alone cannot absorb all of Asia @-@ s imports, Secretary Daley added. </s> <s> We will not be the dumping ground for troubled economies. </s> <s> Just look at Japan @-@ s trade surplus with nations outside Asia, he said. </s> <s> It is almost three and a half times as large as it was a year ago. </s> <s> This is a major source of instability. </s> <s> And such instability caused by <unk> of cheap imports can lead to political unrest, as people fear for their jobs. </s> <s> Today, Mr. Daley inched toward action: The Commerce Department issued a ruling that allows the complaints of the steel industry and unions to be heard on an expedited basis. </s> <s> The action would also allow for stiffer duties to be imposed on foreign steel if the Commerce Department determined that the products are, in fact, being dumped at unfairly low prices. </s> <s> Mr. Clinton noted that decision in his speech today. </s> <s> The Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission share authority for ruling on whether dumping is taking place and for imposing compensatory tariffs. </s> <s> Setting limits on imports would almost certainly violate international trade agreements. </s> <s> Until today, the President had not discussed the problem of rising imports from Asian or other troubled economies in public. </s> <s> On the contrary, agreements between the International Monetary Fund and Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea all assume significantly increased exports by those countries, because their devalued currencies make their goods less expensive abroad. </s> <s> The Treasury Department signed off on all those accords after detailed study of their economic assumptions. </s> <s> But now, the political costs of those accords are becoming clear. </s> <s> The steel industry has been the first to scream, and loudest, but makers of auto parts, machine tools and <unk> are also complaining that foreign goods are being sold here at prices below their production costs. </s> <s> There is certainly an effort now to try to take pressure off the U.

</s> <s> If there has been no transition of the kind imagined in Russia since 1991, what has been the main development? </s> <s> In my experience, the words collapse, disintegration, catastrophe come most readily to the minds of most Russians. </s> <s> But what more specifically? </s> <s> So great has been the nation @-@ s economic and thus social catastrophe that we must now speak of an unprecedented development: the demodernization of a 20th-century country. </s> <s> I do not mean only the <unk> and colonial-like economic dependence so often protested in the Russian opposition press but also a literal and more general demodernization of the foundations of social life: production, technology, transportation, finance, education and more. </s> <s> Suffice it to say that many highly educated Russian professionals now must grow their own food to survive, millions of other citizens lack adequate nutrition, medicine and fuel, and male life expectancy has plunged to barely 58 years. </s> <s> Any economic achievements since 1991 seem to have been barely more substantial than a Potemkin village and were all but vaporized by the financial meltdown in August and September 1998. </s> <s> As for political reform, it also seems likely that the quasi-autocratic system imposed by Mr. Yeltsin in 1993, linked as it was to his economic policies, will soon be dismantled, substantially amended or transformed into full dictatorship. </s> <s> For Russian studies, there is a profound irony in all this. </s> <s> Theories and concepts of modernization have long occupied a large place in the field. </s> <s> And for all its social science pretensions and new jargon, transitionology is itself little more than a <unk> version of those old approaches in Russian studies, now equating modernization with an American<unk> economy. </s> <s> And yet, our transitionologists missed the most important development in Russia since 1991, the exact reverse of the process they professed to study, the country @-@ s progressive demodernization. </s> <s> Indeed, who has been most on target? </s> <s> The advocates of the transition who said that nuclear perils were steadily diminishing or those of us who warned about the unprecedented catastrophe unfolding in Russia? </s> <s> In the end, the result of transitionology has been to create a Russian studies without Russia. </s> <s> To repair the damage done to the field, Russian studies must change direction in fundamental ways. </s> <s> First and foremost, it has to liberate itself from comparative political and economic theories that know little or nothing about Russia and return to the kind of close empirical research that underlies the best area studies. </s> <s> Without it, no purportedly universalistic concepts can be assumed to fit the largest, most diverse and perhaps most politically consequential country in the world. </s> <s> Second, Russianists have to reopen large historical questions. </s> <s> Why, for example, insist that the country @-@ s real transition from Communism began only under Mr. Yeltsin, when the process was already so far along in the Soviet system under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev? </s> <s> Although many scholars argue that the Soviet Union was incapable of real change, as evidenced by its collapse, I think a strong case can be made that by 1991 the system had turned out to be remarkably reformable, certainly much more so than Western experts had thought. </s> <s> And the Soviet system did not collapse but was abolished by Mr. Yeltsin and his allies. </s> <s> If so, it may be that President Gorbachev @-@ s much scorned <unk> and goal of a mixed economy, based on combining marketization and privatization with whatever was viable in the old state system, were @-@ and may still be @-@ the best way to reform Russia and other Soviet republics that is, with more durable results and at lesser costs. </s> <s> I am not optimistic that such questions will be reopened, even though they are being raised anew in Russia today. </s> <s> But if they aren @-@ t, there will be no change for the better in the field of Russian studies, just as there has been no such transition in Russia these past seven years. </s> <s> CRISIS IN THE <unk>: THE RUSSIANSBy Celestine BohlenRussia announced today that it is sending a military reconnaissance ship to the Mediterranean to monitor the conflict in Yugoslavia, a move criticized by the United States State Department as unhelpful as NATO @-@ s bombing of Yugoslavia <unk>. </s> <s> At a news conference today, Defense Minister Igor D.

S. preserve. </s> <s> Economically, of course, Europe is no longer just a regional power. </s> <s> It is the economic and commercial equal of the United States on the global stage, and Washington has accepted that it must share global economic decision<unk> with the EU on issues such as the future of the world trading system. </s> <s> But when economics merge into geopolitics, as they increasingly do in a globalized world, Washington has been somewhat schizophrenic. </s> <s> It chides an @-@ inward-looking @-@ EU for its lack of strategic interest in say, China or Iran but bristles when Europe actually wants a say in international political issues such as the Middle East peace process. </s> <s> So it is perhaps not surprising that the new burst of integration under way in Europe has provoked conflicting responses in Washington. </s> <s> One reaction, espoused by a few leading administration officials and perhaps also by President Bill Clinton, is optimistic and positive. </s> <s> This school of thought sees huge possibilities for political and economic burden-sharing between two more equal partners. </s> <s> In the words of one member of Congress, a stronger and enlarged EU will be @-@ a force for creative stability in the world, the like of which has never been seen, in partnership with the United States. </s> <s> @-@ A senior U.

Thomas R. Wilson, director of intelligence for the military @-@ s Joint Staff, said in an interview. </s> <s> We can deal with it. </s> <s> The deputy chief commander of the Russian Navy, Vice Adm.

Putin, to decide whether to engage in serious negotiations over a system, something that is not yet clear. </s> <s> The administration has given the Russians a draft proposal to change the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, which is considered the linchpin of arms control because it limits the number of defensive weapons, thereby discouraging the spread of offensive weapons. </s> <s> Although President Clinton has not yet made a decision to deploy a defensive system, the Pentagon is fast moving ahead with plans to build one. </s> <s> The first phase, intended to counter missiles from North Korea, which is seen as the most immediate threat, would include 100 missile interceptors and launchers based in Alaska that rely on upgrades to five existing early-warning radar systems. </s> <s> Also included in the initial phase would be a new radar facility on Shemya Island in Alaska. </s> <s> The second phase, focused on potential missile threats from Iraq, Iran and Libya, would include 100 to 150 more interceptors and launchers and several more of the new radar systems. </s> <s> Although a senior defense official said the United States has not told Russia how many of the new radar systems would be included in the second phase, Pentagon officials have previously indicated that eight more would be built in Alaska, California, Massachusetts, North Dakota, Hawaii, England, Greenland and South Korea. </s> <s> American negotiators have sought to reassure their Russian counterparts that the limited defense system would not have enough interceptor missiles to threaten Russia @-@ s strategic nuclear deterrence. </s> <s> Even with planned reductions in nuclear stockpiles to 1,500 to 2,000 in the next phase of arms reductions, known as Start III, they say Russia could easily overwhelm the system. </s> <s> In a sense, the American negotiators were trying to convince the Russians that the cold war doctrine of mutually assured destruction that both countries have the ability to destroy the other remains in place and would survive the deployment of any antimissile system. </s> <s> However, Mr. Collins said today that Russia @-@ s main concern was not as much the interceptors themselves, but the construction of the radar sites and other facilities, which could become the foundation of a larger defensive system that could threaten Russia @-@ s deterrent ability. </s> <s> At the Pentagon briefing on Wednesday afternoon, American officials tried to ease those concerns by highlighting what they said were limits of the new systems. </s> <s> The meeting took place in the conference room normally reserved for the most sensitive discussions of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other senior military commanders. </s> <s> The proposed radar systems are known as phased-array. </s> <s> They are able to track many moving objects at once and, since they operate in 8 to 12 gigahertz frequency, provide far greater resolution than early-warning radar systems now used to watch for a Russian nuclear attack, the officials said. </s> <s> Led by the under secretary of defense for policy, Walter B. <unk>, the Americans told the Russians that the new radar had inherent limitations that would not allow a quick expansion of the shield. </s> <s> Each radar system, they explained, is able at any given moment to track only a limited number of missiles, as well as <unk> and other penetration aids that would be included in any ballistic missile strike. </s> <s> The reason, the officials said, was the dwell time it would take the radar to distinguish the actual missiles from the <unk>. </s> <s> The exact number of missiles the systems could counter is classified, but during the briefing Mr. <unk> told the Russians that a radar system like the first one on Shemya Island would be able to track and destroy only 20 to 30 missiles with high confidence, an official familiar with the briefing said. </s> <s> Simply expanding the number of missile interceptors would not significantly expand the effectiveness of the missile defense system since the new radar system would quickly reach what one senior official described as the saturation point. </s> <s> Doubling the number of interceptors with the same radar and command and control infrastructure would shoot down only a couple dozen more warheads, Mr. <unk> explained, according to the official familiar with the briefing. </s> <s> In theory, the officials said, the United States could build enough radar systems to eventually overwhelm the Russian stockpile, but it would require several thousand of them and even then be politically and practically impossible because of the costs and the diplomatic sensitivities of placing radar installations in foreign countries. </s> <s> Missile experts raised questions about the Pentagon @-@ s explanations to the Russians. </s> <s> George N.

Warner, a Virginia Republican; and William S. Cohen, the Maine Republican whom Mr. Clinton later appointed secretary of defense. </s> <s> The administration promised to develop the technology for an antimissile system within three years. </s> <s> That would put the United States in position actually to deploy an antimissile system within a second three-year period if new missile threats emerged, or so the White House argued. </s> <s> Hence, the plan became known as three plus three. </s> <s> We sort of created the Pentagon program, Senator Levin said in an interview. </s> <s> We tried to encapsulate where we were going on development. </s> <s> There was another important assumption behind the strategy: The first phase of any missile defense would be based at Grand <unk>, consistent with the ABM treaty. </s> <s> That would enable Washington to avoid a diplomatic rupture with the Kremlin. </s> <s> In the end, Senate Republicans signed off on the deal, but their more <unk>line colleagues in the House balked, and the effort to forge a bipartisan consensus on missile defense fell apart. </s> <s> Still, Mr. Clinton had signaled that he was prepared to consider a limited missile defense to blunt his Republican critics, and conservative Republicans had indicated that they were prepared to one-up the Democrats by pushing for a more ambitious system. </s> <s> It was both a classic example of how the Congress could drive the defense debate and an example of Clinton @-@ s @-@ New Democrat @-@ approach to defense, said Joseph Cirincione, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. </s> <s> Clinton was able to say that he was all for missile defense and put the tough decisions off to the future. </s> <s> The Intelligence A Second Review Sounds the AlarmAs it turned out, missile defense was not a big issue during Mr. Clinton @-@ s re-election fight; Bob Dole, his Republican challenger, barely mentioned it. </s> <s> But it did not take long before the debate re-emerged. </s> <s> This time intelligence was the battleground. </s> <s> The administration had drawn comfort from a 1995 National Intelligence Estimate, coordinated by the Central Intelligence Agency, that concluded that nations like North Korea would need at least 15 years to develop a missile that could strike the continental United States. </s> <s> Republican lawmakers, however, objected to the implication that there was no need to speed development of a missile shield, and they set out to challenge it. </s> <s> Their first attempt failed. </s> <s> To review the intelligence report, they established a panel whose chairman was Robert M. Gates, the director of central intelligence during the Bush administration. </s> <s> But its 1996 report basically supported the view of American intelligence experts. </s> <s> Two years later, however, the Republicans tried again. </s> <s> This time Congress set up a panel headed by Donald Rumsfeld, who was defense secretary under President Gerald R. Ford and was at Governor Bush @-@ s side recently when he unveiled his plan to build a more expansive missile defense system if elected this fall. </s> <s> Three of the nine members of the commission were picked by Democrats, including Richard Garwin, a renowned physicist who is a Republican but is known for his fierce independence. </s> <s> Mr. Garwin recalled in an interview that while Mr. Rumsfeld conducted the review in a <unk>minded manner, the panel @-@ s mandate was carefully drafted to boost the case for antimissile defenses. </s> <s> The charge was cooked, Mr. Garwin said. </s> <s> We were not asked what where the most likely ways in which the U.

If the Republicans had based their crusade for missile defense on the Rumsfeld report alone, however, they might still be fighting an uphill battle. </s> <s> But just a month after the report came

probably hit land mass but might not land anywhere near a city. </s> <s> More recently, American intelligence has concluded that the North Koreans have abandoned work on that missile in favor of the Taepo Dong-2, a two-stage missile that uses a cluster of No Dong engines as a first stage and a No Dong missile as a second stage. </s> <s> The Taepo Dong-2 has never been flight-tested, a vital step in developing a missile, and cannot be test-launched under a accord that the United States has negotiated with North Korea. </s> <s> The North Koreans, however, have continued work on the program. </s> <s> If North Korea did conduct a flight test and built another Taepo Dong-2, it might have a rudimentary long-range missile in a matter of months, according to American intelligence officials. </s> <s> While such a missile could deliver a nuclear-size payload to Alaska and Hawaii, it could not reach the continental United States unless the North Koreans added a third stage. </s> <s> But a third stage would make it less accurate, American officials say. </s> <s> Even if North Korea did violate the test ban and developed an effective intercontinental-range missile, it would have enough nuclear material only for two warheads at most, according to United States intelligence, compared with more than 6,000 missile warheads for the United States. </s> <s> The missile threat from other nations is more distant, and American specialists are divided over whether Iran can field an intercontinental-range ballistic missile by 2010. </s> <s> As for Iraq, American intelligence experts

measures and providing faster relief for companies and workers, according to a report the administration will release today. </s> <s> The 240-page report, a copy of which was made available by an administration official, seems timed to help Vice President Al Gore shore up political support from steel workers and unions. </s> <s> Some union leaders sharply criticized Mr. Gore @-@ s support for the China trade bill this year, and many have expressed disappointment that the administration has not done more to guard against sudden increases in <unk> steel imports. </s> <s> The report, prepared by the Commerce Department, says the administration will start imposing duties on imported steel faster than it has in the past and in some cases even before reaching a final judgment on whether a foreign country is selling steel in this market below cost so as to minimize the damage to domestic companies and workers when dumping does occur. </s> <s> Administration officials said they had also requested funds to set up an interagency rapid response team that would distribute aid to <unk>hit communities as soon as it became clear that a sudden rise in import volumes threatened profits and jobs. </s> <s> Many of the nation @-@ s leading trading partners, including Japan, South Korea, Russia and Brazil, have complained bitterly about United States antidumping laws, especially as used to shield the politically sensitive steel industry. </s> <s> The administration @-@ s pledge to use those laws more actively seems sure to inflame already tense trade ties with those nations, especially with Japan. </s> <s> Just last month, foreign steel producers released their own study that contended that the American restrictions on imported steel had cost consumers here as much as @-@ 150 billion over the last three decades. </s> <s> Trade barriers and government subsidies effectively raise the cost of everything with steel components, from aircraft to kitchen <unk>, said that study, which was prepared by lawyers for foreign steel makers. </s> <s> The Commerce Department @-@ s study makes essentially the opposite claim. </s> <s> It suggests that if anything, the United States has erred on the side of free trade and needs to speed up and stiffen its response when the industry faces unfair competition from abroad. </s> <s> The United States imposed antidumping duties on hot rolled steel from Russia, Japan and Brazil in 1998. </s> <s> The administration decided at the time that the United States was flooded with <unk>cost steel after the Asian financial crisis that began in 1997 led to devalued currencies and bankrupt companies abroad. </s> <s> Some steel industry and union officials have complained that it took the administration too long to respond to that crisis. </s> <s> This is designed to make sure that what happened to the industry two years ago doesn @-@ t happen again, a senior Commerce official said. </s> <s> We want to move as fast and as aggressively as we can, because we know that it takes time for the remedies to work. </s> <s> In the future, the report says, the administration will act faster to break out and distribute trade data on steel. </s> <s> That will help people spot evidence of potential import surges. </s> <s> When surges occur, the administration will act faster to head them off, the report says. </s> <s> Among other actions, the report recommends starting negotiations with trading partners as soon as it becomes clear that an import surge is in the works. </s> <s> The report also says that the administration will work to address long-term structural factors that cause foreign countries to sell steel at prices the United States has determined are below the cost of production. </s> <s> Russia, the report says, has allowed steel exporters to escape paying bills at home, allowing them to sell goods abroad below cost. </s> <s> Japan allows steel makers to coordinate with one another and keep prices artificially high at home to help promote <unk> exports. </s> <s> South Korea has unsound banking practices that have effectively subsidized a glut of steel production capacity. </s> <s> The administration will use its influence at the World Bank and other international lending agencies to end loans that expand steel production capacity, the study says. </s> <s> It will also propose that international economic bodies study how best to knock down informal barriers that protect and subsidize steel companies. </s> <s> By <unk> CarvajalFirst came horror, then instant history: Russia @-@ s new president

J., turned up the expected mix of mundane mob staples: extortion, cigarette smuggling, money <unk>. </s> <s> But federal agents said they also came across a bit of criminal enterprise that for pure creative corruption struck them as remarkable: a <unk> web of companies was smuggling tens of millions of gallons of American<unk> grain alcohol including some from one of the country @-@ s oldest distilleries to Eastern Europe to <unk> a seemingly boundless thirst for that most Russian of spirits, vodka. </s> <s> The smuggling genius, such as it was, lay in the fact that the 192-proof alcohol from America @-@ s heartland was disguised with <unk> and shipped in giant <unk> marked as windshield-<unk> fluid, cologne, <unk> and cleaning solvent. </s> <s> Once in Russia, the smugglers, using a chemical formula provided in some cases by an American distiller, removed the <unk>, diluted the grain alcohol with water and sometimes added what the federal authorities said was vodka flavoring. </s> <s> The product, which was then distributed by groups controlled by the Russian mob, thus evaded millions of dollars in import taxes and tariffs. </s> <s> The reconstituted <unk> and cleaning solvents investigators said that when the <unk> was effectively removed, it was, all things Russian considered, not half bad found a welcome and lucrative place in the black market. </s> <s> As part of the case, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and <unk> are investigating as many as six distillers around the United States, and nearly a dozen brokers and freight forwarders, several law enforcement officials said. </s> <s> Investigators suspect that the <unk> have ties to some of the most powerful mob clans in Russia, and that the organizations, including the Solintsevskaya and Ismailovskaya groups, control the distribution of the alcohol there and in some countries in Eastern Europe, the officials said. </s> <s> It takes a lot of organization to get millions of gallons from the distilleries in the U. S. to the streets of Moscow, Edgar A. Domenech, the special agent in charge of the A. T. F. @-@ s New York office, said recently. </s> <s> The agency, which in addition to investigating firearms and explosives trafficking regulates the alcohol industry, is handling that part of the joint investigation, while the F. B. I. is overseeing other aspects of the case, including those involving Russian organized crime. </s> <s> Since the days of the czars, when half of Russia @-@ s state revenues came from government-controlled vodka sales, the drink has played an outsize role in the nation @-@ s life and politics. </s> <s> It accounted for 35 percent of the Soviet Union @-@ s income until oil and gas became big money makers in the 1980 @-@ s. But that number plunged to roughly 4 percent in Russia after President Boris N. Yeltsin liquidated the state monopoly in 1992. </s> <s> And with the collapse of the economy, many local producers failed and foreign distillers began to export vast quantities of grain alcohol to Russia and neighboring countries. </s> <s> But when the Russian government slapped heavier tariffs on imported alcohol in the mid-1990 @-@ s, the black market exploded, opening up more opportunities in the trade for the ubiquitous Russian mob. </s> <s> Now, untaxed, smuggled and <unk><unk> vodkas known as <unk> are believed to account for more than half of the estimated 568 million gallons consumed in Russia annually. </s> <s> The economics of the smuggling scheme are straightforward: the alcohol can be bought in the United States and shipped to Russia for far less than it would cost a Russian company to produce it legally or illegally in that nation, law enforcement officials said. </s> <s> Organized crime realized you can buy grain alcohol for dirt cheap in the United States and export it for free, said Bruce Gourlie, an F. B. I. special agent in Newark who has traveled to Eastern Europe in connection with the case. </s> <s> By smuggling, you can make a tremendous amount of money, because the tariffs are so high because they @-@ re trying to protect the domestic alcohol industry. </s> <s> As a result, over the last few years a new class of <unk> developed, riding shotgun on convoys of huge tanker trucks hauling illegal alcohol across the borders of Georgia and other countries into Russia. </s> <s> Enormous seizures became commonplace, and in at least one case, according to government news agency reports, smugglers with guided antitank missiles clashed with the border police, who halted their convoy of 550 tanker trucks. </s> <s> About the same time, another class of lower-level bootlegger was shipping grain alcohol to Russia and Ukraine by sea, disguising it as cleaning products. </s> <s> Now, a federal grand jury in Newark is hearing evidence in the case, several officials said. </s> <s> Court papers show that one Russian immigrant involved in the scheme pleaded guilty in April to a single count of conspiracy and is cooperating with federal prosecutors in Newark. </s> <s> Also cooperating in the case, according to the court papers, is a Missouri distillery founded in 1856 that made its name selling rye whiskey in Wild West saloons and recently got caught disguising its grain alcohol for shipment to the wild East. </s> <s> The company, McCormick Distilling of Weston, Mo., north of Kansas City, provided nearly five million gallons of disguised grain alcohol to a freight forwarder operated by the Russian immigrant, the papers said. </s> <s> The freight forwarder shipped the alcohol to Russia and the Ukraine from 1996 to 1999, according to the papers, filed in Federal District Court in Newark by Mark W. Rufolo, the assistant United States attorney who is overseeing the investigation. </s> <s> McCormick, which boasts on its Web site that it is listed on the National Register of Historic Sites because it is the oldest distillery in the United States operating at its original site, dyed the alcohol and provided the <unk> with a chemical formula to later remove the <unk>, other court papers said. </s> <s> Earlier this year, McCormick pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of making a false entry in regulatory documents, in which it identified the alcohol as nonpotable products including Rainbow Cleaning Solution and Cleansol. </s> <s> The company agreed in June to pay @-@ 2 million in penalties, with @-@ 1 million in reparations going to the government of Ukraine, and accepted a one-week suspension of its license, documents show. </s> <s> It was one of the largest such settlements in the history of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and <unk>, officials said. </s> <s> In a written statement released by its lawyer, Christopher Lee Milner, McCormick said that no one at the company knowingly conspired with organized crime elements to smuggle alcohol into Eastern Europe. </s> <s> The statement also said that no one at McCormick profited individually from the alcohol deals, that the company was never fully paid for the alcohol and that it was continuing to cooperate with federal investigators. </s> <s> The Russian immigrant who is cooperating with prosecutors officials fear his life is in danger admitted that his company shipped the alcohol in seagoing <unk> that each held <unk> 55-gallon drums, according to the court papers. </s> <s> He said his company shipped 600 such <unk> about 4<unk> million gallons from May 1996 to January 1999, generating @-@ 40 million, according to a criminal information, a document detailing the charges to which he pleaded guilty. </s> <s> The millions of gallons smuggled out is not a huge amount in the domestic distillery business. </s> <s> In 1996 alone, companies in the United States legitimately exported more than 100 million gallons of <unk> spirits, much of it in the form of pure grain alcohol. </s> <s> And Americans consume about 350 million gallons of <unk> spirits a year, according to industry estimates. </s> <s> In 1999, roughly 700 million gallons of grain alcohol was produced in the United States and reported to the A. T. F., the federal agency said. </s> <s> Investigators nonetheless believe that the illegal shipments were just part of a much broader pattern of smuggling and other crimes by Russian mob groups. </s> <s> The money made by these illegal operations is funneled back into other illegal activities such as money <unk>, firearms and narcotics trafficking, said Jeffrey A. Cohen, the A. T. F. @-@ s assistant chief counsel. </s> <s> And while federal authorities here pursue their investigation, the government in Russia has begun an effort to stanch the <unk> in tax income there caused by vodka smuggling, which some estimates put at more than @-@ 400 million a year. </s> <s> To consolidate state control over the industry, President Vladimir V.

S. and Western influence. </s> <s> In terms of global resources, the report concludes that by 2015, nearly half of the world @-@ s population more than three billion people will be in countries lacking sufficient water, and that even more genetically modified crops or projects to desalt sea water will not substantially help. </s> <s> The 70-page report is one result of an unusual <unk>month collaboration between the National Intelligence Council, a sort of analytical think tank of senior intelligence officials that works alongside the C. I. </s> <s> A., and dozens of outside scientific, diplomatic and corporate experts. </s> <s> It is not a traditional intelligence report based on classical intelligence sources and methods. </s> <s> This was a serious effort to provide a context to discuss opportunities as well as threats to the U. S. national security community, said John Gannon, chairman of the National Intelligence Council, in an interview. </s> <s> The purpose, he said, is to get policy makers to focus on long-term global trends and to think beyond the ordinary concerns of the intelligence community. </s> <s> An advance copy of the report, which will be released on Monday, was made available to The New York Times. </s> <s> Copies of the report were delivered late last week to the White House, other agencies of government and members of the team of President-elect George W. Bush. </s> <s> Some intelligence officials are concerned that persuading the Bush national security team to look beyond traditional threats will be particularly challenging. </s> <s> In an article in Foreign Affairs, written during the campaign, Condoleezza Rice, who will be Mr. Bush @-@ s national security adviser, argued, for instance, that national interest was too often replaced by humanitarian interest or the interests of the international community. </s> <s> Instead, she suggested, the United States should promote what is in its own interest democracy or free trade, for example. </s> <s> But other intelligence officials say a greater problem is that the structure of the national security bureaucracy leads it to look at the world first country by country and then in terms of geographical regions. </s> <s> You try to tell people that disease is rising in four out of five continents well, the regional assistant secretaries have to be persuaded to put it on their agendas first, said one senior intelligence official. </s> <s> Although the conventional wisdom in Washington, particularly on Capitol Hill, is that China will become more of a regional military threat, the report concludes that modernization of the country @-@ s agricultural and national infrastructure will be higher priorities than military investment. </s> <s> The evidence strongly suggests that China @-@ s new leaders will be even more firmly committed to developing the economy as the foundation of national power and that resources for military capabilities will take a secondary role, it says. </s> <s> Despite all the intelligence resources devoted to China, the report states repeatedly that it cannot say with any certainty what the Chinese state will look like in 15 years. </s> <s> While most of those taking part in the study concluded that economic growth would continue, the report acknowledges that it will be difficult to meld the openness that growth requires with political control. </s> <s> Estimates of developments in China over the next 15 years are fraught with unknowables, the report bluntly states. </s> <s> The outlook for Russia, particularly its economy, is bleak. </s> <s> Besides a crumbling physical infrastructure, years of environmental neglect are taking a toll on the populations, a toll made worse by such societal costs of transition as alcoholism, cardiac diseases, drugs and a worsening health delivery system. </s> <s> The Russian population, which will become more sickly, may shrink in size from 146 million to 130 million in 15 years, the report says. </s> <s> Even under a best-case scenario of 5 percent annual economic growth, Russia would attain an economy less than one-fifth the size of the United States @-@ . </s> <s> In the Middle East, by 2015, there will be a Palestinian state, the report says, but Israel will have attained a cold peace with its neighbors, with only limited social, economic and cultural ties. </s> <s> A key driving trend for the Middle East in the next 15 years will be population pressures. </s> <s> Even now, in nearly all of the Middle Eastern countries, more than half of the population is under 20 years of age. </s> <s> In much of the Middle East, populations will be significantly larger, poorer, more urban and more disillusioned. </s> <s> The report concludes that the population of the world will grow from the current 6<unk> billion to 7.2 billion by 2015. </s> <s> Ninety-five percent of that growth is expected to occur in the developing world, and nearly all of it in rapidly expanding urban areas. </s> <s> Megacities of more than 10 million people will continue to grow, straining or even crippling roads, bridges and <unk> and electrical systems. </s> <s> The population of Jakarta will more than double, from 9.5 million to 21.2 million; Lagos will double from 12.2 million to <unk> million. </s> <s> The good news is that there will be enough energy resources in 2015, despite a 50 percent rise in global demand, the report says. </s> <s> It also predicts that there will be enough food to feed the world @-@ s growing population, although poor infrastructure and distribution, political instability and chronic poverty will lead to malnutrition in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. </s> <s> The main resource problem will be water, the shortages so acute that they could cause regional instability. </s> <s> Problems could include Turkey @-@ s construction of new irrigation projects on the Tigris and Euphrates, which would reduce the water flowing into Syria and Iraq, and ambitious projects in Ethiopia and Sudan that could divert water from the Nile and reduce the flow into Egypt. </s> <s> In terms of disease, the report underscores earlier intelligence projections that AIDS and tuberculosis are likely to account for the majority of deaths in most developing countries in 15 years. </s> <s> In some African countries, average life spans will be reduced by as much as 30 to 40 years, leaving more than 40 million children <unk> and contributing to poverty, crime and instability. </s> <s> In many cases the report makes stark predictions without offering specific evidence or footnotes. </s> <s> These are some of its other judgments: @-@ Japan will have difficulty maintaining its current position as the world @-@ s third-largest economy. </s> <s> @-@ India most likely will expand the size of its <unk> force. </s> <s> @-@ Pakistan @-@ s nuclear and missile forces will continue to increase. </s> <s> @-@ Russia will not join the European Union. </s> <s> @-@ The very concept of belonging to a particular state will probably erode. </s> <s> In one of its most sweeping conclusions, the report says governments will have less and less control over flows of information, technology, diseases, migrants, arms and financial transactions, whether legal or illegal, across their borders. </s> <s> States with ineffective and incompetent governance not only will fail to benefit from globalization, it says, but in some instances will spawn conflicts at home and abroad, ensuring an even wider gap between regional winners and losers that exists today. </s> <s> Globalization, the report said, will not lift all boats. </s> <s> By Barbara CrossetteSecretary of State Madeleine K. Albright tried today to convince the world that the United States is not threatening to undercut a quarter century of progress on arms control by developing a new antimissile defense system that has drawn criticism from both Russia and China. </s> <s> If the Clinton administration were bent on sabotaging the ABM treaty and strategic arms control, she told an international arms-control conference, we have surely gone about it in a strange way in the open, with care and in consultation not only with Congress, but after extensive discussions with our allies and other countries, Russia and China emphatically included. </s> <s> In a speech at the opening of a conference called to review a treaty banning the spread of nuclear weapons, Dr. Albright also said the United States had reduced its nuclear arsenal by 60 percent since the end of the cold war, and had joined in cutting NATO @-@ s nuclear stockpile by 85 percent. </s> <s> She spurned calls for the quicker elimination of nuclear arms. </s> <s> Unfortunately, none of us has it within our power to create overnight the conditions in which complete nuclear disarmament is possible, she said. </s> <s> The speech offered no new initiatives but was more of an accounting of how the administration wants to define its record. </s> <s> Dr. Albright walked into an almost solid wall of criticism of the United States at the General Assembly hall because of what is widely perceived as the slow pace of nuclear disarmament more than a decade after the end of the cold war and because of the fears that the proposed American antimissile defense system will start a new arms race. </s> <s> Furthermore, the United States, which last fall saw the Senate reject another crucial accord, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, after the administration had fought for its approval by United Nations members in 1996, is seen as setting a bad example for other countries that can now cite political pressures for refusing to sign. </s> <s> The Clinton administration @-@ s legacy is the re-legitimating of nuclear weapons after the end of the cold war, said Daniel Plesch, director of the British American Security Information Council, an independent research group in Washington and London. </s> <s> India and Pakistan, which tested nuclear weapons in 1998, and Israel, which is assumed to have nuclear arms, also were criticized today, and heard demands that they adhere to the treaty to halt the spread of nuclear weapons. </s> <s> The treaty, which came into effect in 1970, has been ratified by 187 countries. </s> <s> Only India, Pakistan, Israel and Cuba have refused to sign. </s> <s> Nuclear testing has no place on our planet, said Brian Cowen, Ireland @-@ s foreign minister. </s> <s> The time to rid the world of these weapons is now. </s> <s> Nuclear arms are the only weapons of mass destruction not banned by international treaties. </s> <s> The United States and Russia have a majority of the world @-@ s nuclear warheads. </s> <s> Mr. Cowen @-@ s speech was one of the day @-@ s toughest, but his sentiments were echoed by other governments, independent arms control groups and former American arms-control officials. </s> <s> Republicans in Congress, including Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have been especially harsh in attacking international arms control agreements, and independent experts say they are puzzled by that development. </s> <s> What appears anomalous to me is that historically, the Republican Party has led in the area of arms-control strengthening, Jonathan Granoff, <unk>chairman of the American Bar Association @-@ s committee on arms control and disarmament, said in an interview today. </s> <s> The scuttling of arms control through ballistic missile defense or through the undermining of the commitment to nuclear disarmament contained in the nuclear nonproliferation treaty is against the heritage of the Republican Party. </s> <s> Thomas Graham Jr., who was the Clinton administration @-@ s special representative for arms control from 1994 to 1997 and is president of the independent Lawyers @-@ Alliance for World Security, said that much of the annoyance with the United States stems from commitments all nuclear powers made five years ago to work harder on eliminating nuclear weapons in return for international agreement to make the nuclear nonproliferation treaty permanent. </s> <s> Many non-nuclear weapons states particularly nonaligned countries, but also some Western countries, indeed even some NATO countries believe that the nuclear weapons states have not lived up to commitments that they made in exchange for everyone else agreeing to make the treaty permanent, Mr. Graham said. </s> <s> If that doesn @-@ t change over the next few years, it could have a very negative effect on the long-term viability of the treaty. </s> <s> Although the conference here is focused on the treaty to halt the spread of nuclear weapons, much attention was also given today to the perceived threats to the antimissile accord. </s> <s> Antonio Monteiro, Portugal @-@ s representative, speaking for the European Union, called the ABM treaty one of the pillars of strategic stability and said it must be preserved. </s> <s> Secretary General Kofi Annan also joined in voicing concerns about the disruptive potential of a missile defense system without mentioning the United States when he said in a speech opening the conference this morning that it could well lead to a new arms race.

S. and international programs now exist to reduce the threat of nuclear proliferation in Russia; objectives include downsizing the nuclear complex in targeted areas. </s> <s> More attention within the framework of these efforts should be made in the missile sector, including projects to support economic diversification and job training for displaced workers. </s> <s> This type of initiative may go some way toward <unk> the Kremlin from the political flak involved in closing facilities, and facilitate the transition away from defense production. </s> <s> Meanwhile, the U. S. government and private space concerns should encourage larger entities in Russia, such as <unk> or Energia, to absorb smaller firms. </s> <s> Although such companies might then make stronger competitors to their U.

the sale of its natural resources. </s> <s> In particular, oil and gas dominate Russian exports and tax revenues, setting the nation up for an economic fall when prices decline, as they now appear to be doing. </s> <s> Mr. Illarionov argues that that is not a bad thing: less dependence on oil, he says, forces Russia to compete better in others areas and to spend more wisely. </s> <s> Russia @-@ s

Putin next weekend. </s> <s> That meeting, in Genoa, Italy, is expected to focus on American plans to build the missile shield, which the Americans admit would violate a longstanding treaty between the two nations. </s> <s> The administration @-@ s endorsement of most of the nonproliferation programs begun by the Clinton administration will not surprise most legislators, given that the administration is now trying to avoid being portrayed as <unk>minded on national security matters in its pursuit of a missile shield, and as unresponsive to European support for arms control. </s> <s> Officials said that although cabinet officials had discussed the review @-@ s findings, no final decisions on the recommendations would be made until Congress reacted to the proposals. </s> <s> The administration has begun arranging to brief key legislators on the results of its review, which began in April and was conducted by an expert on Russia on loan from the State Department to the National Security Council office that deals with nonproliferation strategy. </s> <s> That office is headed by Bob Joseph. </s> <s> In interviews, administration officials said the White House would not overlook Russian efforts to weaken the programs by restricting access to weapons plants or by erecting obstacles to meeting nonproliferation commitments. </s> <s> We have a high standard for Russian behavior, one official said. </s> <s> The review has concluded that most of the @-@ 420 million worth of the Pentagon @-@ s programs called Cooperative Threat Reduction are effectively managed and advance American interests. </s> <s> The White House also intends to expand State Department programs that help Russian scientists engage in peaceful work through the <unk>based International Science and Technology Center, which the European Union and Japan also support, and other institutions. </s> <s> But some <unk>ticket programs whose budgets have already been slashed or criticized on Capitol Hill are likely to be shut down or refocused, the official said. </s> <s> Though it is no longer very expensive, another program, the Nuclear Cities Initiative, has already been scaled back by Congress. </s> <s> It was begun in 1998 to help create nonmilitary work for Russia @-@ s 122,000 nuclear scientists and to help Russia downsize geographically and economically isolated nuclear cities, where <unk> people live. </s> <s> Unhappy with both the cost and the Russian reluctance to open these cities fully to Western visitors, Congress has repeatedly slashed money for the program. </s> <s> Under the Bush review, the undefined positive aspects would be merged into other programs, and most of the program closed. </s> <s> The Clinton administration had begun the program to provide civilian work for Russia @-@ s closed nuclear cities. </s> <s> The aim was to prevent nuclear scientists there from leaving for Iraq, Iran and other aspiring nuclear powers. </s> <s> Under the program, the Russians would also have to expedite the closure of two warhead-assembly plants and their conversion to civilian production. </s> <s> The administration will be missing an opportunity to shut down two warhead production plants if it abandons the Nuclear Cities Initiative, said Rose <unk>, a senior Energy Department official during the Clinton administration. </s> <s> The administration says Russia plans to close those two facilities in any event. </s> <s> The White House also intends to overhaul a hugely expensive effort to enable Russia and the United States each to destroy 34 tons of stored plutonium by building facilities in Russia and the United States. </s> <s> The program, as currently structured, will cost Russia @-@ 2<unk> billion and the United States @-@ 6.5 billion, at a minimum. </s> <s> The administration has pledged @-@ 400 million and has already appropriated @-@ 240 million. </s> <s> In February 2000, the Clinton administration wrested a promise from Russia to stop making plutonium out of fuel from its civilian power reactors as part of a research and aid package. </s> <s> While Russia was supposed to stop adding to its estimated stockpile of 160 tons of military plutonium by shutting down three military reactors last December, Moscow was unable to do so because the reactors, near <unk> and Krasnoyarsk, provide heat and electricity to those cities. </s> <s> Critics said the original program was too costly and was not moving forward. </s> <s> But supporters say the Bush administration should try harder to solicit funds from European and other governments before <unk> the effort and walking away from the accord. </s> <s> The administration insists it is still exploring less expensive options. </s> <s> The administration has also deferred a decision on a commitment to help Russia build facilities to destroy 40,000 tons of chemical weapons, the world @-@ s such stockpile. </s> <s> The first plant has been completed at Gorny, 660 miles southeast of Moscow, but American assistance to build a second plant at Shchuchye, 1,000 miles southeast of Moscow, has been frozen by Congress. </s> <s> Many legislators have complained that the Russians have not fully declared the total and type of chemical weapons they made, and that they have put up too little of their own money for the project. </s> <s> In February, however, Russia announced that it had increased its annual budget for destroying the weapons <unk>, to @-@ 105 million, and presented a plan to begin operating the first of three destruction plants. </s> <s> The administration official said this reflected a significant change in Russia @-@ s attitude towards commitments that could have an impact on our thinking about the program. </s> <s> The Russians hope to destroy their vast chemical stocks by 2012, a deadline that will require that they obtain a five-year extension. </s> <s> But Moscow will not be able to meet even that deferred deadline unless construction begins soon for a destruction installation at Shchuchye. </s> <s> The Clinton administration, after Congress slashed funds for the project, lined up support from several foreign governments. </s> <s> Elisa Harris, a research fellow at the University of Maryland and a former specialist on chemical weapons for President Clinton @-@ s National Security Council, said the destruction effort could falter unless the Bush administration persuaded Congress to rescind the ban and finally support the program. </s> <s> Commenting on the review, Leon <unk>, a visiting professor of international affairs at George Washington University and the national security adviser to former Vice President Al Gore, said, By and large they are going to sustain what they inherited, which is good for the country. </s> <s> But the senior Bush administration official said the review did not endorse the Clinton approach. </s> <s> This administration, he said, is determined to establish better and more <unk>efficient ways of achieving its nonproliferation goals and integrating such programs into a comprehensive strategy toward Russia. </s> <s> He said the White House
